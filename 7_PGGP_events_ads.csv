50103,33,EKE14996,,Partial Investigation,"Archaeological Excavation: Service Trench, Bradstow School, Broadstairs","Between the 6th and 27th August 2015 the Trust for Thanet Archaeology carried out a programme of archaeological monitoring and recording prior to and during the excavation of a service trench at Bradstow School, Broadstairs. Previous archaeological work on the site has taken place since 1910. Changes in the plan for the service trench led to the trench being located in an area of high archaeological potential, with excavations indicating the area was intensively occupied from the prehistoric period. Previous work on the site by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology supports this conclusion. The excavation took place in two phases, Phase 2 followed by Phase 1. Phase 1 was the monitoring of two narrow trench cuts through areas of hard standing. Phase 2 required the excavation of a 1.8m wide trench to the archaeological horizon on the grass playing field. Excavation of the service trench, where it crossed the hard standing of the car park and the access road, revealed chalk geology at a depth of 0.3m and no archaeological features. Where archaeological potential was known to be highest, a 2m wide easement centred on the route of the service trench was excavated. Only four previously unknown archaeological features were exposed. Two parallel ditches, a ditch terminal and a single, well defined, circular post hole. The ditches revealed a single sherd of mid-late Iron Age flint tempered pottery and residual patinated struck flint. The re-excavation of previously known features (i.e. grave cuts, two concentric ring ditches, and a chalk quarry ditch cut) was also conducted. The excavation revealed that spatial referencing of previous investigations did not correlate with the features uncovered. Misplotting of the 1910 excavation appears to have led to the misidentification of part of the ring ditch of a barrow as a quarry cut. There is potential for up to four round ditches lined up across the site. The excavation emphasises the complex nature of this prehistoric site which has the potential for regional and even international significance. Finds from the excavation were limited to a very small number of pottery sherds (7), and 76 worked flints, with little evidence to suggest they were contemporary with any features. The pottery sherds ranged in date from Iron Age to modern, with a single sherd of Iron Age pottery representing the most significant pottery find. The excavation uncovered 76 worked flints, most residual within their contexts and few showed diagnostic traits. The raw material was limited to flint - mainly Cortexed nodules and Bullhead Bed Flint. It is possible that many are contemporary with use of the Bronze Age Round Barrow however this is speculation.",,2015-08-06T00:00:00,2015-08-27T00:00:00
50103,34,EKE8865,Watching Brief,Partial Investigation,"Watching brief at Bradstow School, Dumpton Park Drive,  Broadstairs","The watching brief revealed two modern parallel ditches, either land drains or service trenches. A large feature observed along the south east border of the site, had previously been recorded during evaluation works in 2003. It has been interpreted as either the edge of a bronze age barrow ditch, or the edge of a post medieval 18th or 19th century chalk quarry pit.",,2004-04-19T00:00:00,2004-04-21T00:00:00
50103,35,EKE9091,Evaluation,Partial Investigation,"Evaluation at Bradstow School, Broadstairs","This evaluation investigated two areas. Five trenches were cut within the footprint of a proposed annex to the School. One trench revealed a substantial, but undated feature. It was interpreted as either the edge of a Bronze Age barrow ditch, another section of which had been exposed during excavations in 1970-74 (see TR 36 NE 13), or the edge of a late chalk quarry. A linear exposed in two of the other trenches was interpreted as a post medieval field boundary. In the second area two trenches were excavated to the south of the school, on the site of a proposed car park. Two features identified in one of the trenches were interpreted as inhumation burials and as such were likely to be of Anglo-Saxon date (see TR 36 NE 12).",,2003-05-06T00:00:00,2003-05-09T00:00:00

The sitecode was MT82. The earliest features dated to the pre- and early Roman period and were two structures, B3 and B4.  A hearth was also found (1277).  16 pits and two gullies were also found within area MT.  A cremation was also excavated and consisted of cremated bones within a pedestal urn which had been set upright in a small hole. During the Roman period further structures were erected on the site, R31 consisted of post and stake holes.  At the north-west end of the site a row of post-holes, interpreted as fence posts.  Later structures were more substantial, buildings R32, 33, 34, 35, 36, 38 and 40 were all part of a major building programme which saw a planned alignment of streets and structures. At the end of the Roman period a deposit of 'dark earth' built up over the area.  Signs of occupation were represented by structures S30-2, which cut the latest Roman street metallings and the dark earth deposit.  A gap in occupation then seems to have occurred with little evidence other than pits being found until into the Norman period.  During this time the Roman structures were substantially robbed for stone. In 13th century structure L13 was constructed on the site.  A number of clay floors and ovens were excavated within the building..  81 pits dating to this time were also excavated upon MT, most predated the structure.  Slightly later, in 15th century, structureL14 was built.  Later activity had truncated the building and no floor levels survived.  It is thought to have been a latrine or possible have had some industrial use as it was associated with a pit and chute.  A number of pits and some clay quarries were also dug at this time within area MT, as was a well. Post Medieval features included some masonry walls a group of shallow post-holes and a scatter of pits and some cellars.  The earlier well was still and use and modified with a lead draw pipe.  The Marlowe Theatre was built on the site in the middle of 19th century and was finally closed in 1982.",,1982-01-01T00:00:00,1982-12-31T00:00:00

The site was mechanically stripped under supervision by an archaeologist. All archaeological features, deposits and structures were recorded, excavated, and recorded again. A comprehensive soil sampling programme for environmental analysis was undertaken. The earliest material encountered was a possible Mesolithic flintwork assemblage, recovered from later deposits. Two Neolithic pits containing pottery and flintwork assemblages were the earliest datable features. A small early Bronze Age cremation cemetery is the next dateable evidence on the site, one urned and one unurned cremation with associated pits containing pyre debris were found. Medieval land division was also recorded, as a continuation of a medieval field system in an adjacent area of the quarry. Additionally a medieval Jeton was recovered from the topsoil.

An archaeological appraisal was undertaken in advance of the groundwork s to assess the impact of the installation of the new water main on known and unknown archaeological and heritage assets. A visit was made to the Humber Sites and Monument Record to record all of the Heritage assets within the vicinity of the pipeline. These Heritage Assets were mainly Bronze Age Round Barrows along with linear boundaries and a series of Scheduled Monuments. A series of visits were made to monitor the pipeline route which ran for 1.3km along Garrowby Street. A trench was excavated within the road verge using a small 360 excavated within a toothless bucket. Within Stone Dale lay-by. Two pits 1m by 2m and between 1.2m   1.4m deep were excavated either side of the road. Topsoil then solid chalk bedrock at 0.30m deep was identified. The trench ran in a westerly direction for 230m and 1.10m deep. The trench then cut across the A166 for 8m, no Roman or Medieval road surfaces were identified, possibly dues to the 20th century road construction which may have removed earlier road surfaces. Topsoil was identified within the trench to an approximate depth of 0.30m then solid chalk bedrock.  An undated ditch (possibly MHU8441)was identified, which was cut into the bedrock and extended beyond the depth of the trench which was 1.10m deep. The ditch cut was identified for approximately 300m. 560m of the trench and two pits for directional drilling for a 100m section of pipeline was excavated within an earlier PVC main which had redeposited modern deposits up to a depth of 1.10m. Along this section of the pipeline the instability of the soil meant that the trench had to be widened to 2m in sections.

On 1 November excavations were begun, the procedure being to clear away the whole of the top soil and then gravel down to the undisturbed sand. Work did not cease until 28 March, by which time the urnfield had been exhausted and the ground cleared for at least 30 ft beyond its limits. 45 burials were unearthed, for the most part they were irregularly placed and conformed to no formal lay-out or plan. Of the burials, 26 were by cremation only, and 18 by cremation in urns. In 2 instances the urns were associated with food vessels. Two sunken roads were discovered evidently earlier in date than the urn-field. No objects were found associated with any of the burials, but in the top soil there were flint implements, including transverse, leaf-shaped, and barbed and tanged arrow heads, and a solitary ochreous palaeolithic flake. To the west of the urnfield a bronze lead-shaped spear-head was unearthed, while farther again to the west was a built up hearth. Classified Late Bronze Age. Many urns in the British Museum.

The trenches revealed that much of the south-eastern area of the site had been damaged by activity connected with the construction of the Blandford Bypass, which formed the eastern boundary of the site. A single ditch of probable medieval date did however survive between and below the deeper areas of disturbance. The northern and south-eastern areas of the site were however, undisturbed and trenches revealed a number of features of medieval date. These included a hollow way, with probable rectilinear enclosures adjacent to it; a number of postholes suggesting structures; and a cobbled trackway with adjacent ditches and pits. The pottery from the excavated features had a date range of 12th   15th century. Worked flint was recovered from a number of layers but no features earlier than the medieval period were found.'

The excavations were in response to the increasing destruction of the site by industrial development on Grove Trading Estate.The excavations were published in a series of interim reports in the Dorset Proceedings, as well as in two monographs; one dedicated to the cemeteries, the other to the settlements.The excavations recovered the remains of over 1400 inhumations, mainly of late Roman date. Burials were arranged in a series of cemeteries which included a group of stone built mausolea. The earliest settlement evidence was a series of shallow storage pits and flint quarries which may represent a Neolithic settlement. A Bronze Age settlement then became established in the combe at the foot (east end) of the site. The earliest burial was a single Bronze Age crouched burial.

The controlled excavations were initiated as a result of casual discoveries in the locality in 1964 and 1965 and were complemented by fieldwork, including aerial surveillance and watching briefs on development sites. The excavations were in response to the increasing destruction of the site by industrial development on Grove Trading Estate.The excavations were published in a series of interim reports in the Dorset Proceedings, as well as in two monographs; one dedicated to the cemeteries, the other to the settlements.The excavations recovered the remains of over 1400 inhumations, mainly of late Roman date. Burials were arranged in a series of cemeteries which included a group of stone built mausolea. The earliest settlement evidence was a series of shallow storage pits and flint quarries which may represent a Neolithic settlement. A Bronze Age settlement then became established in the combe at the foot (east end) of the site. The earliest burial was a single Bronze Age crouched burial.

20268,307,EDO4115,,Full Excavation (1950-),"Alington Avenue, Fordington, Dorchester, Archaeological Excavation.","An archaeological excavation was conducted by the Trust for Wessex Archaeology at Alington Avenue, Fordington, Dorchester over a 5 month period in 1985, following on from an Evaluation in 1984 (EDO4113) and a geophysical survey in March 1985 (EDO4114). The excavation produced a wealth of evidence for occupation and land use from the later Neolithic to the medieval period.The earliest monument was a Neolithic long barrow, aligned east-west. A bipartite, subcircular enclosure was inserted into the east end of this long barrow, probably in the Early Bronze Age, and five cremation burials were cut into the ditch sides. At the western end of the long barrow, a double ring ditch with a circular timber monument enclosed within its eastern circuit, cut through the silted up southern ditch. Further burials were cut through the ditch fills of the double ring ditch. Two mid-late Iron Age burials in pits were inserted into the eastern ring ditch.A series of irregular ditches appeared to have their origins in the prehistoric period and pre-date a large D-shaped enclosure dated to the Romano-British period. This D-shaped enclosure had a prolonged life with at least three phases of realignment and expansion and the formalisation of a droveway along its northwest side. It probably went out of use in the 3rd or early 4th century AD. Within the enclosure were three stone-footed buildings, together with a number of ovens/driers, pits and wells, part of a farming unit.Over one hundred inhumation burials of late 1st to later 4th century date were excavated. These fall into two distinct burial types: crouched burials of the Durotrigian tradition dating to the early Roman period and the more common late Roman extended burials, usually in wooden coffins. Three cremations were also found. The Durotrigian burials could not be easily associated with any other features on the site, but the later Roman burials were aligned on the D-shaped enclosure.Five rectangular timber buildings and associated post fence alignments were found across the site, together with one possible sunken floored building. These are not well dated but probably date to the Saxon period.",,1985-04-01T00:00:00,1985-09-30T00:00:00

This had indicated that the environment contained oak and hazel woodland which was disturbed by agricultural activity just prior to the construction of the monument. The second pollen sequence is longer and comes from a localised peat filled channell occurring downslope from the archaeological site. This sequence illustrates that the local vegetation had comprised oak and hazel woodland for a substantial length of time. In this profile, three phases of anthropogenic activity have been recognised and it is thought that these relate to the archaeological sites nearby. This had a substantial effect on this fen mire vegetation community and caused oscillations between willow and alder carr woodland.",,01/03/1984,01/04/1984

A radiocarbon date on the cremated bone fell in the range 2120-1880 cal BC and is a valuable addition to the small number of securely-dated Early Bronze Age burials in Cornwall with metalwork associations. This early date also makes a major contribution to the debate on the sequence of Trevisker Ware as the vessel, of gabbroic clay, has a band of incised chevron decoration. Lipid residue analysis showed traces of ruminant dairy fat. This paper examines the significance of unmounded burial sites in Cornwall and also assesses the importance of Early Bronze Age burials around Harlyn Bay which have produced an unusually wide range of artefacts.",,1990-01-01T00:00:00,1990-12-31T00:00:00

The programme of archaeological recording included controlled soil strips in those areas where there was thought to be high potential for buried archaeology. This included fourteen stretches of the pipeline and the five compounds. A watching brief was also carried out along the remainder of the pipeline corridor (Figs 1-4).The mitigation work identified a series of archaeological finds and features spanning the last 10,000 years, which included a Mesolithic flint working site at Gavercoombe Farm (Tintagel); approximately 31 prehistoric pits; a probable standing stone within a ditch at Trethevey; a possible standing stone at Bossiney; a Beaker cist or stone-lined pit close to California Quarry (Forrabury cliffs); a cist or stone-lined box at Trevalga; a prehistoric field system of probable Bronze Age date at Bossiney_; a Late prehistoric/early medieval cist grave cemetery at Forrabury; an early medieval cist grave and other structures at Tintagel. In addition ditches, boundaries, and other features dating from the medieval, and post-medieval periods were also recorded. The excavation of a prehistoric roundhouse at Trevalga is covered by a separate report. A possible Bronze Age cairn north of Gavercoombe Farm (Tintagel) was also discovered, although this lay outside of the pipeline corridor and was not further investigated.The archive report is the first stage in a programme of post excavation analyses which will lead to publication.",,2009-05-07T00:00:00,2010-03-31T00:00:00

The fieldwork, funded by English Heritage, consisted of topographical and geophysical surveys, evaluation trenching, and excavation and reinstatement of the cist grave.Within the north-south orientated cist were the fragmentary remains of a crouched human skeleton, laid on its right side with its head to the north and facing to the west. In addition to the sword, which survived within a bronze scabbard, the grave goods included a mirror, shield fittings, a sword belt ring, a brooch and a spiral ring (all of copper alloy), together with a shattered tin object. There was also evidence for the grave having contained a sheepskin or fleece and woven textile incorporating goat and other animal hairs. This is the only known Iron Age grave to contain both a sword and mirror, raising interesting questions as to the gender significance of both these grave goods. The unique combination of metal objects will be central to future discussions concerning the development of British Iron Age metalwork. Analysis of skeletal material showed that the buried individual was about 25 years of age, although preservation of bone and DNA was too poor to determine the person's sex. A long bone fragment was submitted for radiocarbon dating, giving calibrated date ranges of 200-45 cal BC; the metalwork typology narrows this range to the first half of the first century BC. The dates indicate that the Bryher mirror is one of the earliest known, if not the earliest, British decorated bronze mirrors.The discovery of a second cist (not excavated) a few metres to the south west of the original one suggests the possible existence of a cist cemetery. The cists lie within an ancient terraced field system that appears to be broadly contemporary.Further evaluation trenching revealed Iron Age - Romano-British settlement remains at the southern end of the cist field, where a stone-walled building situated on top of a terrace contained a stone-lined drain and may have been used as a byre. After abandonment the building was infilled with domestic rubbish, including limpet middens and burnt material. Other contemporary settlement remains were uncovered in a field to the east where limpet middens overlay a substantial wall, on top of which was found a stone bowl. Stratigraphic and ceramic evidence indicates a break in occupation between the second century AD and the post-Roman period. Limpet middens, visible on the ploughed surface of the cist field and the field to the west, contained E ware, indicating renewed activity in the area centred on the seventh century AD.",,01/09/1999,31/10/1999

It may be one of the sites seen ""near Berie Beach"" in 1936 by Lacaille (1937), but his directions are vague. In 1972 only part of the cairn showed through the sand as an irregular oval of boulders, and this led Stevenson to suggest that it might be a Viking grave, and to recommend excavation before it eroded further.It was excavated in 1976 and 1978 and proved to be a Bronze Age cairn of three periods, each associated with a burial, overlying a ploughed soil. The first burial was an inhumation in a short cist under an unusual D-shaped cairn with a well-defined kerb. This cairn was disturbed when a hole was dug through it for a small corbelled cist containg a cremation urn. Finally a kerb cairn with two concentric kerbs was built over the earlier structures.

The excavation of a Bronze Age cist burial took place during fieldwork concentrated on the adjacent putative Norse burials, which lay c10m to its NW.  Excavation revealed an orthostatic, slab-lined, sub-rectangular cist with maximal internal dimensions of 1.2m from E to W by 0.9m from N to S. This contained a well-preserved crouched adult inhumation.  The skeleton was enveloped within a distinct stained sand, deriving from the decay of the soft body parts and/or textiles.  An intact undecorated vessel lying beside the skull was the only gravegood present.  An arc of stones immediately above the orthostats of the cist represents the basal course of a corbelled vault above the burial chamber.  This suggests that the cist must have been situated within a now eroded mound. The cist had been inserted through the existing ground surface, a small patch of which was preserved on the N side of the cist. Elsewhere all sand deposits outside the cist are almost entirely scoured.  A rough arc of boulders around 1.5m from the S and W of the cist may have delimited the extent of the mound.  Archive and publication reports of fieldwork results are currently in preparation.  Sponsor: Historic Scotland  CFA 1992.In August 1994 two further Viking Age graves were excavated beside the three adult burials recorded in 1992 (supra).  Further erosion within a deflation hollow on the SE slopes of Cnip headland had revealed human bones in an eroding sand face less than 1m W of the 1992 excavations. A bone pin, two amber beads and a small quantity of human bone were recovered by a representative of Historic Scotland during an initial site inspection.Subsequent excavation revealed a substantially eroded grave, comprising a rounded scoop filled by light brown sand, and containing an infant orientated NW-SE. Only the skull and upper left torso of the skeleton were preserved in situ.  A single amber bead was recovered from beneath the jaw, suggesting that it had formed part of a necklace.During cleaning of areas of exposed ground surface contemporary with the Viking Age cemetery a second grave was located adjacent to that detailed above.  Upon excavation, it contained an undisturbed flexed neonate inhumation orientated approximately E-W.  A small lump of iron, as yet unidentified, was located beneath the rear of the skull.  The burial lay within a rounded scoop measuring 0.66m E-W by 0.48m by up to 0.20m deep and containing a light brown sand fill.  As with the other burial, no surface marking of the grave was evident.Cleaning of exposed areas of ground surface on a terrace up to 3.8m wide revealed no evidence for further graves within c 9m SW and c 6m NE of the excavated grave group. The burials excavated in 1992 and 1994 therefore appear to have formed a discrete cluster, possibly reflecting familial or kinship relationships. The grave group lay on a level patch of ground, and it is likely that the graves were deliberately sited on a terrace on the hillside.  No evidence for any formal boundary to the cluster of graves was identified.Three other eroding features were examined during fieldwork.  A cluster of stones c 1.5m across, located c 1m N of a multi-phase Bronze Age cairn excavated by J Close-Brooks in 1976 and 1978, had been identified as a possible cist roof.  No structure was revealed within the stones; two pits at least 1m in diameter were partly revealed in the trench immediately to the E of this.  The stones lay on a Bronze Age cultivated soil previously identified by Close-Brooks, indicating that the features were broadly contemporary with the adjacent cairn.A disturbed cobble hearth was identified c 15m NE of the calm.

Owned by the monastery of Iona  from the late 14 th century, the group was referred to in 1575 as 'Heisker of the Nuns', and there is a reference to a monastic settlement on Shillay, although the precise location of these religious outposts has been forgotten. It was here that Lady Grange was kept prisoner in 1732 -4, having been kidnapped from her Edinburgh lodgings by a party of Highlanders whose Jacobite plot she had overheard and threatened to disclose. Her keeper, the tenant of Heisker, allowed her to attempt an escape, but she was betrayed and moved to St. Kilda. As with many other satellite Hebridean isles, the population of Heisker waxed and waned over the centuries. By 1810 it had dwindled to nothing, but was replenished during the Clearances and had risen to 13 5 by 1891. In 1928 there were only eight families remaining, and by 1942 all had left.

The burial ? which may be older than the roundhouse rather than a foundation deposit ? consisted of a single individual probably male and aged about 12 years.  The skeleton had been dismembered by butchery probably some time after death when the body was partly decomposed, and the fragments distributed among the four pits.  Cannibalism was ruled out as there were none of the marks of skinning, filleting and butchering which were found on the animal bones.  Barber suggests that the boy may have died under ?inauspic-ious circumstances?, perhaps at sea,  and had therefore been buried in this peculiar way when he was found on the beach [3, 778].The pits under the roundhouse were dated to between 460 +/- 50 bc (GU-2161) and 385+/- 50 bc (GU-2017);  these dates are not calibrated for carbonate retention [3].

Tidal erosion has removed approximately 7m to 8m of the beach-front in the past 10 years and continues to expose cultivated soils and midden associated with the previously excavated prehistoric structures.  Cut into the upper part of these deposits was a long cist containing an extended unhumation.The cist was overlain by stained sand with indistinct layer boundaries, over a buried soil of dark-brown sand, some 0.05m deep.  This latter soil extended unbroken over the cist, separated from it by a thin layer of stained, grey-brown sand, indicating that the cist was roofed originally at ground level.  The cist was cut directly into the top of layers rich in peat ash and other indicators of domestic midden.  Less than half of the cist survived, the remainder having fallen onto the beach.  The surviving structure indicated that the cist had been in excess of 1.3m in length, with a width at the surviving end of 0.5m, and a depth of 0.4m.  It was lined with side slabs of local gneiss and capped wirth lintels of the same material.  Two lintels survived of which the one nearest the erosion face had partially slipped, crushing and wdging the upper rib cage of the skeleton.The skeletal material appears to represent the remains of an extended inhumation aligned NNW (the head) to SSE.  Two cattle teeth were found in the area of the neck and shoulders of the skeleton.  These were the only non-human skeletal material in the burial and appear to have been deliberately placed.

NF/7763 6157The remains of this probable wheel-house on Baleshare Island in North Uist  have been exposed by coastal erosion (the name means 'The red smiddy').  Midden material in layers in the sand has been observed over the years, including plain ?wheelhouse pottery? in an upper layer [3, 1963] and, in a lower level, thick sherds. Human remains have been excavated at the site but the Iron Age dwelling, if it exists, remains unexplored.In the 1980s a programme of record-ing eroding archaeological sites in Bale-share was  undertaken and a vast amount of data collected [9]. The methodology employed meant that  only the eroding sections of sites were explored and that their nature could not be investigated  in depth.   One of the sites is thought to have been near or at the supposed wheelhouse and dumped material in a stone passage (`Block 7?) revealed most of a pot which bears a remarkable resemblance to that found in 1956 at Bruthach a?

The ongoing erosion has created 4m high W-facing dunes and the urn was exposed near the base of a sequence of midden deposits. The midden extends c40m to the N, 10m to the S and is c1.5m deep.The pot had been deliberately deposited above a layer of midden material. Although the base of the pot was intact the vessel was not complete and only one side of the pot, which had collapsed, was in situ. The pot is an undecorated, straight-sided, bucket-shaped vessel, and has a straight rim with a slightly bevelled interior. The pot contained nine quartz pebbles within loose dark brown sand. There was no evidence that the pot had contained cremated material. However, a thin black residue was visible on the inner surface of the pot. The contents of the pot were recovered for further analysis. The pot was covered by further midden deposits. A setting of five, irregular shaped stones which had been set within one of the upper deposits may have been placed to mark the pot?s location. Further midden deposits had accumulated above the stone marked layer, one of which contained several pieces of plain pottery, a bone point and unworked bone.A large amount of archaeological material has been recorded at Ceardach Ruadh over the last century, and the progressive and ongoing erosion has revealed a complex sequence of Late Bronze Age to Late Iron Age activity, as well as a number of burials.

It was investigated by Beveridge who found three of its sides intact but the east end entirely lost. At that point there were slight indications of a narrow passage bending towards the south. Part of a fallen capstone was found at the western end and what appeared to be the main capstone a few yards away. The chamber was paved throughout.  Finds included fragments of pottery, a flint scraper and a broken hammerstone. (E Beveridge 1911)  The site was visited by Miss Henshall in 1962, when the cairn was found to be considerably robbed and disturbed:  on the south side stones have been built into a rough breakwater projecting from the cairn to make a sheltered landing-place.  (Information from MS, A S Hensall [Chambered Tombs of Scotland, Vol. 2])  The finds are in the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland (NMAS).  E Beveridge 1911; Proc Soc Antiq Scot 1912.

Visited by OS (W D J), 21 June 1965.NF 7684 7520  A trial excavation was conducted, by the author in association with CFA, in the chamber of this Neolithic tomb which had been previously investigated by Erskine Beveridge in the first decade of this century (NF 77 NE 15). The chamber lies at HWM and is highly vulnerable to tidal erosion and scouring.Excavations revealed an inner and outer chamber divided by a substantial threshold slab. The inner chamber was neatly paved, as Beveridge had suggested, and also incorporated a hearth in its NW corner. Further excavation, in a 1 x 1m area where there was no paving, revealed underlying and apparently undisturbed deposits, the earliest of which was a dark silty material banked up against the sides of the chamber.Paving in the outer chamber had been all but removed by scouring, apparently since Beveridge's time, revealing a partial lower paving of small stones and a post-hole containing two sherds of Neolithic pottery (Hebridean Ware), probably residual.The paving and associated features in both chambers appear to date to a period after the removal of the tomb's capstones, possibly in the Bronze Age or later, and may relate to secondary buildings built into the body of the cairn. The excavations have, however, demonstrated the survival of earlier deposits and artefactual remains at risk from further erosion and scouring.Sponsor: Historic ScotlandI Armit 1996.NF 7684 7520  Further excavations were conducted during May 1997 at the Neolithic chambered tomb of Geirisclett (NMRS NF 77 NE 15). Trial excavations in 1996 (Armit 1996) had demonstrated that primary tomb deposits in the burial chamber and passage areas had survived previous investigations c 1900-10 by Erskine Beveridge, but that these were now under threat of scouring by tidal action. The 1997 season was designed to excavate fully any deposits surviving in the burial chamber and passage areas in advance of their destruction. The structure of the cairn was not examined as it is not considered to be at risk in the medium term. The burial chamber is an open-ended rectangle, 2.7 x 1.4m, and is divided into two compartments by upright sill stones c 0.5m high. Its walls are defined by five large orthostats, 1.15-2m high. The passage leading to the chamber is c 2.1m long and of uncertain width, and the kerb of the cairn was traced running in a gentle arc to the N from the passage for c 4.5m.The inner compartment of the burial chamber contained a sequence of fills which can be divided into four units - patches of a primary floor, in situ secondary fills, disturbed secondary fills, and tertiary paving associated with hearths.

The cairn is largely as described by Henshall and it remains unclear whether the large prostrate slab at the SW side of the chamber entrance was a portal stone or an upright of a facade. Excavation of the chamber and its floor deposits in 1997 revealed that it was divided into two compartments by upright sill stones 0.5m high, and presumably these stones equate with those shown on Henshall?s plan and described in the accompanying account as `two small stones placed across the chamber floor? (page 516). However, Beveridge?s photographs of the chamber taken in 1908 do not appear to show these stones and indeed the interior appears relatively stone free. This suggests that Beveridge?s photographs were taken after he had cleared the chamber of `the accumulated rubbish?, and raises the possibility that he introduced the sill stones, perhaps in an attempt to stabilise the sides of the chamber and minimise further tidal erosion.Visited by RCAHMS (ARG,SPH) 31 August 2009",,2009,

Hazelnut shell fragments were recovered from bulk samples taken from the site and submitted for radiocarbon dating. The results indicated occupation of the site ranged between 5715?5386 cal BC (SUERC-38832: 6750?30 and SUERC-38834: 6525?30 calibrated using OxCal 4.1), confirming the site as the third identified Mesolithic site in the Western Isles.Further sampling of the eroding section was conducted 4?7 September 2012. The eroding section was cleaned back to expose a 5m stretch of deposits that were photographed, drawn and geo-referenced using GPS. Bulk samples were taken of all excavated material. In addition, multiple spot, column and Kubiena samples were taken for geoarchaeological analysis.The site consisted of a buried land surface, a scoop feature and associated midden deposits. The scoop cut into the old ground surface and associated midden deposits and this feature was filled with an ash spread and a shell-rich midden deposit. The Mesolithic remains were overlain by a substantial machair dune. Processing of the bulk samples recovered thousands of burnt and unburned shellfish, fish and animal bones, charred hazelnut shells and charcoal. Worked flint and quartz flakes were also retrieved.

This was followed by partial excavation by CFA on behalf of Historic Scotland, establishing that the cairn has an unusual kerb about 8.4m diameter.The cairn is located in a field, on a gently rising summit immediately W of the existing road, A859.M R Curtis and G R Curtis 1995.NB 2179 3473  In the course of road widening through Breasclete, a hitherto unknown kerb cairn of unusual morphology was revealed. Located 1.6km from the Callanish standing stones, the new site seems to form part of the wider ceremonial complex. When soil stripping for the road improvement scheme began, R and M Curtis discovered a scatter of flaked quartz on the line of the road. Work on the road was delayed by Western Isles Council whilst an excavation was carried out between October and December 1995.The identified structure was deturfed and excavated by hand, and three phases recognised.Phase 1: Pre-cairn features.  An old ground surface was present below the main material of the cairn. Ard marks were sealed beneath this cairn material, predominantly in the NE quadrant. The ard marks ran both N-S and E-W. No ard marks were discovered outside the area occupied by the cairn. Whilst this may reflect differing preservation, especially as the general area has been cultivated in more recent times, a ritual explanation cannot be discounted.A large number of post-holes were also sealed by the old ground surface (see entry below). It is probable that they were cut from a higher level than the old ground surface, but were only preserved coherently beneath this layer. Certainly a number of the post-holes seem to flank the path into the cairn (see below) and should properly be regarded as part of phase 2, although they only survived as negative features in the till. Phase 2: The kerb cairn.  The cairn was unusual in having two kerbs. The outer kerb was c 8m in diameter and roughly circular. It was constructed of large local stones, laid flat, not set on end as appears to be the case in most other kerb cairns. It had been heavily robbed in places, surviving at its most complete in the SW quadrant. In the NE quadrant both kerbs had been heavily disturbed. The inner kerb elsewhere was formed of smaller stones and survived particularly well on the W side of the monument, although its shape could still be discerned on the E side. It took the form of a flattened circle, the flattened portion being on the E side. It appeared that the 'mathematical construction axis' of this inner kerb points directly up the avenue of the main site at Callanish. The maximum diameter of the inner kerb was about 6.5m.A central cist within the cairn was formed by three orthostats (one alleged) set into the subsoil. A slightly broken, plain cremation urn lay next to the W orthostat and a quantity of the cremated bone which had spilled from the urn was found to its S. No covering slab was found. It is possible that such a slab had been robbed, as the site had been horse-ploughed and drained, and had no significant overburden. An organic covering can also be envisaged. Pollen analysis of samples taken from the central cist may confirm this.A pathway of flat-laid slabs led to the central cist from the NE. This feature was apparently flanked by posts (see above).The SW portion of the cairn was heightened by the presence of large boulders. The remainder of the inner cairn material was of redeposited peaty soil. Layers of orange and black burnt peat were predominant in the cairn construction in the NW portion. Although no stratigraphic link existed between the central cist and this burnt material, it is probable that the peat was deposited later, as it respected the cist spatially. This argues against the peat having been burnt in situ; a hypothesis which will be tested by the analysis of magnetic susceptibility samples taken",,01/10/1995,31/12/1995

A large headstone, which clearly cut the dark layer, lay at the W end of the burial. The dark soil lay directly under the topsoil and cut into windblown sand below. At first only three small areas of human remains were apparent, but with further careful excavation it became clear that most of the remaining burial remained undisturbed and partially articulated. It is likely that redeposited bones recovered from the machair topsoil above originally belonged to the crouched burial, as the elements missing from this burial are all to be found in the group of redeposited remains - many of which also had dark staining. In the process of excavating the mandible and upper spine, a polished pebble and a smoothed worked piece of pumice were recovered. Immediately to the E of the headstone a broken, almost complete pot was uncovered lying smashed on its side. The fabric is suggestive of a prehistoric, possibly Bronze Age, date.

Visited by OS (NKB) 18 May 1966.Several mounds of this large Bronze Age burial cemetery were excavated during July to September 1994 as part of the Orkney Barrows Project.  The aim of the excavation was to gauge the archaeological potential of mounds after several forms of damage common to such earthworks had taken place. Accordingly mounds in a range of conditions were excavated, from those that had been ploughed flat to some that were still reasonably upstanding.A great number of burials were discovered, all of which were cremations, both as primary burials underneath the mounds, and in cists and pits around the mounds.  Of the mound of which there were no surface remains (27) [at HY 2638 1536] there survived remnants of the mound material and old land surface, both of which were very disturbed.  In the northernmost of the mounds (9) [at HY 2642 1541] the central burial survived intact despite extensive rabbit burrowing throughout the mound fabric, and comprised a cist containing a cremation accompanied by a pot lid.  Corbelling was placed over the cist and a kerb surrounded it, after which the mound was built.  A second episode of mound construction had included the insertion of a cist above and off centre to the first.A cist containing a cremation was also found to be the first element of the other severely truncated mound (3) [at HY 2645 1528].  While the lid of this cist had been removed by the plough and a side slab displaced, the cremation remained substantially undisturbed.A similar sequence of events to that described for mound 9 above could be traced at mound 8 [at HY 2641 1538]. A large cist was surrounded by a well-faced single-coursed kerb, and the mound built up with a succession of deposits of soil.  A rectangular stone box containing burnt organic material was covered by a very much more substantial kerb which surrounded a second major episode of mound enhancement.It was mound 7 [at HY 2640 1535] which had been the focus of the most post-mound activity.

The aim of the excavation was to gauge the archaeological potential of mounds after several forms of damage common to such earthworks had taken place. Accordingly mounds in a range of conditions were excavated, from those that had been ploughed flat to some that were still reasonably upstanding.A great number of burials were discovered, all of which were cremations, both as primary burials underneath the mounds, and in cists and pits around the mounds.  Of the mound of which there were no surface remains (27) [at HY 2638 1536] there survived remnants of the mound material and old land surface, both of which were very disturbed.  In the northernmost of the mounds (9) [at HY 2642 1541] the central burial survived intact despite extensive rabbit burrowing throughout the mound fabric, and comprised a cist containing a cremation accompanied by a pot lid.  Corbelling was placed over the cist and a kerb surrounded it, after which the mound was built.  A second episode of mound construction had included the insertion of a cist above and off centre to the first.A cist containing a cremation was also found to be the first element of the other severely truncated mound (3) [at HY 2645 1528].  While the lid of this cist had been removed by the plough and a side slab displaced, the cremation remained substantially undisturbed.A similar sequence of events to that described for mound 9 above could be traced at mound 8 [at HY 2641 1538]. A large cist was surrounded by a well-faced single-coursed kerb, and the mound built up with a succession of deposits of soil.  A rectangular stone box containing burnt organic material was covered by a very much more substantial kerb which surrounded a second major episode of mound enhancement.It was mound 7 [at HY 2640 1535] which had been the focus of the most post-mound activity.  The sequence that can be ascertained so far is that a large central cist containing a cremation was located next to a pyre.  A circular setting of stone slabs at the top of this mound lay directly above this primary burial.  A clay platform was laid in a crescent formation around the N side of the mound, which sealed a stone box containing burnt material, and a pyre site on the W side, and the ruins of a ring cairn surrounding a pit containing a cremation on the NE side. Upon the platform another ring cairn was constructed, and it would appear that a structure was built onto one side of this cairn.  This structure appeared to have been a building, inside which the area to the S which was roughly paved with slabs which overlay a cremation pyre, and an area to the N along which a long piece of stone furniture was positioned.In between the clay platform and the mound many cists and pits with burials in were inserted.  This was the latest phase of activity at this site.  The cists and pits also surrounded and respected the ring cairn and building.  Some of the small stone boxes were post holes rather than cists, and presumably acted as markers for the cists, as cists and pits did not intercut.  Small upright stones amongst the cemetery also seem to have fulfilled this role.  A path of small stone slabs led into this cist cemetery from the W.The SW quadrants of both mounds 5 [at HY 2644 1531]and 6 [at HY 2645 1533] were excavated, and both mounds were surrounded by",,01/01/1994,31/12/1994

The work mainly involves gradiometer survey but EM (electromagnetic) work has been carried out on a sub-sample of the area.Initial results and analysis indicate that the windblown sands identified in the northern fields of the WHA XI work continue across the current survey area and that little of archaeological importance is visible. This may reflect the burial of sites by significant amounts of sand and the consequent weakening of magnetic enhancement to below readily detectable levels. The existence of former sand quarries in this area is indicative of the depth and extent of the sand deposits. Further analysis and interpretation is required, but this survey work adds to a detailed picture of c70ha around Skara Brae and the Bay of Skaill, significantlyenhancing our ability to understand this landscape.Archive: OCGUFunder: University of OxfordMary Saunders ?

They were made of flagstones and from 75 - 90 cm (2.5 - 3 ft.) long and about 45 cm (18 in.) wide and deep, and contained burnt bones and ashes.

One of the cists had a bowl-shaped stone vessel with ashes and fragments of bone.Petrie continued the excavations below these cists and found the ruins of a circular building, probably a broch, the walls of which were at that stage still standing up to 1.8 m (6 ft.) high;   the ruins now stand scarcely 60 cm (2 ft.) above the surrounding field. Petrie [2] and Laing [ ] supposed that the broch belong to the Stone Age at the latest because they thought the cists to be of Bronze Age date;   the broch was of course in ruins and covered by earth before the cists were inserted into the ?howe?.    This diagnosis was made in spite of the fact that a sherd of Roman Samian ware had been found in the broch.  Part of the wall in the west arc had been destroyed before Petrie arrived and this doubtless contained the main entrance.  A mural stair was uncovered at about 3 o'clock,  with a stair-foot cell to the left and steps rising to the right.  A long mural cell was at about 11 o'clock with the doorway to the central court at one end of it instead of, as is more usual, at the centre.  A well was found in the central area with a drain leading from it towards the broken area where the entrance probably was.  There was supposed to have been a straight wall running across the inner court and overriding the well: it would therefore have been a secondary insertion.  Also probably secondary were several radial slabs on edge against the inner wall face.   Doubts about the reliability of the drawings of these feature on the site plan have been expressed [8, 56].   Part of the wall of the cell is still visible.The date of the broch can be assigned to within the Iron Age because of the fragment of Roman pottery if for no other reason.  The cist graves inserted into its ruins are therefore not Bronze Age in date but even later than the broch.  The ""eagle"" supposed to have been seen on one of the capstones suggests that the cemetery may have been Pictish, in part at least, but even so the cremations inside the cists, sometimes in pots, suggest that a very ancient funerary tradition had survived on Orkney from pre-Iron Age times. Dimensions.  According to Petrie the overall diameter is about 21.0 m (69 ft.), the internal diameter exceptionally large at 13.7 m (45 ft.);  thus the walls proportion is unusually low at 34.8%.   Measurements from SSW to NNE  in 1963 gave an overall diameter of 21.8 m (71 ft. 7 in.) and a wall thickness at the latter end of 3.8 m (12.5 ft.);  the wall proportion would thus be 34.9%. Accurate measurements of the surviving inner wall face in 1985 revealed that the central court is constructed very precisely around a true circle with mean radius of 6.83 +/- 0.12 m, or a diameter of 13.66 m (44.79 ft.)

Magnetometry was used over most of the area, with selective areas being covered by resistivity. Preliminary results appear to confirm the presence of several very slight mounds, and mounds which are no longer extant. The results also indicate pits, probably containing cremations, which lie around the mounds, particularly focusing on the largest mound.Report lodged with Orkney SMR and the NMRS.Sponsors: Historic Scotland, Orkney Islands Council, Orkney College, University of Manchester.J Downes, N Card and A Challands 2001HY 342 174  In July 2001 geophysical and topographic survey was undertaken at the Knowes of Trotty (HY 31 NW 42; DES 2001, 71), showing that this impressive Bronze Age barrow cemetery was much larger and more complex than previously thought. Many new features were identified, including pits, areas of burning, pyre sites, enclosures and a ring-ditch feature.Seven small trenches were opened in 2002 over a variety of anomalies to test some of the geophysical results and preliminary interpretations. In each trench archaeological features relating to the cemetery were encountered. This ranged from an Early Bronze Age building at the N end of the cemetery, to pyre sites, pits, and a very truncated kerbed cairn. In one trench, between Mounds 8 and 9, seven cists, all containing cremations, were uncovered. A polished stone axe lay between two of the cists.

The mound was excavated by W G Grant in 1937, who found that the SE end had been so badly damaged that it obscured all trace of the entrance, and that an earth-house had been constructed in the easternmost half of the cairn.  Other Iron Age building, datable by pottery (J Phemister 1942) and other relics, lay on and around the cairn.  The mass of masonry (the unhatched area in Fig.26, A S Henshall 1963) which lies at the SE end of the cairn is too dilapidated for identification but from it springs a thick wall which curves towards the shore.

It has now been placed under the guardianship of the Dept of the Environment who have enclosed it in a stone building.  The cairn, rectangular in plan with rounded corners, measures 106' 9"" in length and 42' 6"" in width, with the main axis SE-NW. It is bounded by an elaborately built wall-face with another wall-face 4' 6"" to 7' 9"" within it. The outer wall-face is constructed with two horizontally laid foundation courses; the inner wall-face survives up to a height of 6' and is built of horizontally laid slabs. The passage opens from the SE end of the cairn. The outer end was found blocked by masonry, its outer face flush with the outer wall-face round the cairn, and the inner end was similarly blocked; no roofing remains.  The chamber is 76' long by 6' 6"" to 8' wide, divided by pairs of transverse upright slabs into twelve compartments from 4' to 7' long. The walls are of well-built vertical dry masonry.  At the NW end of the cairn there had been a secondary occupation at a higher level. There seemed to have been a passage leading from the NW end of the cairn to the chamber as a height of about 3' above floor level. Some secondary constructions were also found against the N corner of the cairn, including a cist-like tank.  Two walls spring from the N and E corners of the cairn.

The top of the cist was barely below the surface of the farmyard in front of the steading 4m E of the NE corner of the house, which occupies the summit of a low rise one of many such hillocks in the area. It appeared that the cist did not have a single-slab cover but was roofed by the corbelling-out of smaller slabs from the corners, but of this roof of course only a small portion remained in position. As it would be necessary to fill the cavity with hardcore to allow the passage of farm machinery, and the compaction of the hardcore on to the cist contents would damage these, it was decided to excavate the contents. A small area E of the cist was also excavated in order to allow the bottom of the cist to be reached. In this area beneath some 80mm of farmyard metalling, a packing of horizontally-laid flat slabs was encountered, with several layers of such slabs underneath them. It was clear that these were the remains of a cairn of stones which had been built around the cist. The lower half of the cist cavity was dug into natural clay. It appeared that the stones of the cairn had simply been carried corbel-fashion over the cist to form its roof.The cist, which has its longer axis NNW-SSE, is made of 4 slabs uniformly some 30mm thick. The end-slabs are embraced by the side-slabs. The N end-slab 485mm long and the S one 525mm. The two side-slabs are both longer than the cist itself, projecting some distance beyond the end-slabs at all four corners. As it was considered undesirable to excavate the unthreatened area beyond the cist itself the ends of these slabs were not located except for the N end of the E slab which extended 150mm beyond the end-slab of the cist. The internal measurements of the cist on the E are 735mm and on the W 760mm. After removal of the debris which had just fallen into it, the cist was empty except for a deposit of ashes and very small burnt bone fragments some 80mm thick, on its floor. This floor was not a single slab but was formed of a number of small paving-stones set in clay. The depth of the cist, between this floor and the top of the side-slabs, was 540mm.On removal of the floor, the side and end slabs of the cist were found to contiue down for a further 120mm below the floor level, being set close-fitting into slots dug in the glacial clay.

When recovered for the museum, this consisted of a lump of material which had been completely turned over by the plough. Immediately under the pot fragments as lying, was the turf, indicating that the urn had been buried with its top just below the surface. It is likely therefore that this was the first time this particular spot - a very stony hillock - had been ploughed, although the rest of the field has been cultivated of old. The urn possibly had been buried upright in a hole dug into the the shale bedrock, here barely 100mm below surface, the plough having sliced off the top and displaced this to one side; but probing among the plough-furrows failed to locate the main body of the urn which may still be buried there.

Varme Dale is a dispersed scheduled collection of six mounds and barrows and the visit focused on an unscheduled outlier mound at HY 40716 18792 added to the group from a 1981 account (HY41NW 2), and the highest altitude mound at 49m OD. A second smaller outlier mound, c3.5m wide by 0.3m high was noted c18m W of the first at HY 40699 18786.The various clusters of monuments are almost certainly parts of general Bronze Age activity planned to exploit the extensive panoramic outlooks across the Bay of Firth. The modern nomenclature and protective zoning tends to artificially divide the traces into segments which underplay the full spread. At a detailed level, there are differences in recognisable size, the probable content of contained cists and maybe variations in construction, but the overall pattern is a series of low earth burial mounds, 5?15m in diameter and 0.3?2.0m high. The RCAHMS records suggest Verme Dale has at least seven recognisable mounds, whilst nearby Knowes of Euro has two mounds, and West Puldrite four mounds. This gives a total of at least 13 surviving mounds, and has increased significance when the full group is viewed as a single landscape phenomenon, which may originally have contained many more elements within its zonal spread.The various hillslopes around the Bay of Firth have a very high distribution of Bronze Age mounds and tumuli and this specific Enyas hillslope gives an unexpected sightline beyond the encircling horizons to the hills of Hoy through the Finstown gap.

The work by Renfrew on the chambered tomb was carried out between 1972 and 1974 and the discovery of the roundhouse was not anticipated.   It was the first in Orkney to be assigned to the late Bronze Age or early Iron Age periods and the discovery shed an entirely new light on the broch period in those islands, hitherto hardly understood and relying entirely on the evidence from old excavations (no new broch has been explored by the spring of 2002).   The early date of the foundation of the house, probably in the 6th or 7th centuries BC (the excavator suggests c. 700 BC), is supported both by C14 dates and by the small amount of associated pottery. The house was built by removing part of the cairn material around its entrance passage and building the circular wall partly on the old ground surface of clay and partly on the base of the cairn material.   The wall was originally about 80 cm thick, widening to 1.0 m at the short entrance in the SE;  it enclosed an area some 7.0 m in diameter.   The NW part of the wall overrode the entrance passage of the Neolithic tomb but it was not clear whether this was exposed during Iron Age times, as it was at Howe;  at a late date it seems to have been entered.   The remains of a hearth were found on the NW side.There were alterations to the interior subsequently, involving the construction of various partition walls and, later, the thickening of the roundhouse wall itself.

Up to 1898 it appeared to be a small heather-covered knoll about 4' high, but in that year part of the upper chamber was exposed and access was gained to the intact chamber and passage below. It was completely excavated in 1937, and the upper chamber covered with a domed roof.  The cairn has a diamaeter of about 30' and is bounded by a wall-face of horizontally laid stones.  Surrounding the cairn is a spread of loose flat stones forming a sort of platform. An alley, clear of stones, led through it up to the W edge of the cairn. The cairn covers two separate chambers, one directly above the other. The upper, at ground level and entered from the N or uphill side, is placed centrally in the cairn; the lower is subterranean and entered from the S.  The passage to the upper chamber is 11' long, 1' 9"" wide and 3' maximum high. The upper chamber measures 15' 6"" by 6', its main axis at right angles to the passage. It is divided into two unequal compartments with rounded ends. Three stone cists, measuring about 1' 6"" by 2', with cover-stones, had been built on a layer of earth about 1' thick between two upright slabs in the N wall of the W compartment. The lower chamber is entered by a passage 2' wide and 4' high at its inner end but contracting to 1' 5"" and 2' high at the outermost lintel. The passage is 19' long from the chamber thus continuing 5' 6"" outside the cairn above. Outside the roofed passage the sloping sides of the trench are visible, lined with walling but without lintels. The walls continue down the hillside for 19' narrowing to only 2 1/2"" wide by the entrance to the ""miniature chamber"". This small channel has been called a drain but this is obviously not its purpose.  The lower chamber is entirely subterranean and roughly oval with the main axis at right angles to the passage.  It measures 12' long by 5' 4"" wide and is divided by five vertical slabs into four compartments opening from a central space. The miniature chamber at the end of the passage extension is also subterranean. It is roughly oval in plan, the main axis lying SW-NE, 5' long by 4'4"" wide. Four upright slabs are set radially in the wall and hardly project into the chamber.  The entrance is by a vertical drop into a narrow extension of the chamber on the SW. Finds include several skeletons and cremated bone, two complete Unstan bowls and fragments of others, a perforated secondary Neolithic mace-head, a flint arrowhead, flint scrapers, thirty-five disc beads of grey shale etc, which, except for the skeleton remains, have been donated to the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland.

Upon arrival at the site it became apparent that more than half of the cairn had already been lost to coastal erosion. Of the remaining cairn there was a central area extending nearlya metre from the section supported by a shelf of bedrock. This spur of surviving cairn must have lain very close to the centre of the original plan of the cairn and it was here that a steatite vessel was positioned. It was surrounded by placed stones and covered with a capstone and was positioned over an area of burning and burnt material thought to relate to a funeral pyre.The vessel was almost complete but was obviously badly damaged with numerous cracks and distortions visible. The vessel is a flat-rimmed, wide-mouthed, sub-circular tub-like vessel with steeply angled, rounded walls.

Burial deposits (human bone, animal bone and pottery) were discovered on the floors of the first 3 stalls, and an unusual double cist-like arrangement occupied the floor of the fourth and northern-most-compartment.  These deposits were sealed by collapsed chamber and cairn material inter-mixed with which were human and animal bone, amongst the latter there being the talon of large birds of prey.  At the N end of the site a separate and apparently earlier structure was located. The exact nature of this structure has not yet been fully resolved, paricularly since it was largely destroyed in the process of its incorporation into the cairn of the chambered tombs.

The skeletons in each grave lay N and S in several tiers one above the other, the heads of the skeletons of one tier lying N and the other S and so on alternately.  Five or six tiers were counted in one grave and six skulls in each tier, and the other grave was believed to contain about the same number which would give about 60 or 70 skeletons altogether.

A low irregular mound in pasture at 20m OD to N of the Pierowall, was partially excavated in 1981 in advance of quarrying operations. The limited excavation showed that the mound contained the remains of an Early Iron Age settlement of the 1st and 2nd millennium which had destroyed all but the lowest metre or so of an underlying chambered cairn.(Confirmed by A S Henshall).  Attention to the site had been drawn by the discovery of a large decorated stone (1.30 x 0.41 x 0.52m) thought to have come from approximately where the cairn passage would have passed through the inner wall-face, and thus it may have been a passage lintel. It was found in two pieces, decorated with two pairs of spirals, concentric rings and other motifs, closely related to Irish megalithic art (cf: Newgrange). Two smaller decorated stones were found in the quarry dumps. Only a small part of the SE side of the cairn was exposed. The estimated diameter was about 18m edged by a revetment wall-face which stood up to 1m high in 14 courses; the bottom course was of very large slabs projecting about 0.1m. About 1.8m behind this was a second wall giving an estimated diameter of about 14m, and standing about 0.7m high in 8 courses. SSW of the estimated centre of the cairn, the core butted against two large slabs about 0.6m apart which were interpreted as part of a passage.  Immediately S of the wall-face the spread of rubble from the cairn was interrupted by the formation of a secondary platform on which had been built a rectangular structure dated to the late 3rd millennium and asssociated with Grooved Ware sherds. At about the same time, the cairn was levelled and the outer wall-face and rubble behind it were paved over at a height of 1.1m above ground surface.  Subsequently, after a period of abandonment a stone round house was built just within and concentric with the outer face of the underlying cairn. The interior of the round house was at a lower level than its outer wall and had been dug into the remains of the cairn. A large flint assemblage and human & animal bones were also found at the site.  In 1983 only the base courses of the SE arcs of the wall-face of the cairn were to be seen, and the profile of the mound in the quarry section.

Two discrete types of deposit were found, one derived from deliberate, anthropogenic fishing and other from otter spraint; both were found throughout the tomb with little evidence of spatial or chronological patterning.Analysis has shown that people were fishing for cod family fish, including large cod and ling, as well as inshore,coastal species like wrasse. Comparisons with contemporary assemblages suggest that this was typical of the period. The presence of large ling suggests deep-water fishing from boats at some distance from the shore. Small quantities of pierced vertebrae from ling and cod-family fish were found throughout the tomb and may have been worn as beads. Parallels from other Neolithic Orcadian sites are discussed in the full report, as are their potential symbolic meanings. A single cod vertebra had been butchered with a stone tool and is likely to represent the earliest evidence for fish butchery and processing in the Neolithic.The fish remains may have been introduced to the tomb as grave goods, as feasting while interring or visiting the dead, or they may represent food consumed while building the tomb. The presence of otter spraint throughout this and other tombs suggests that otters were contemporary with the use of these tombs, and that they were probably accepted, or at least not discouraged, by humans.Archive: RCAHMS (intended).

In the area centred at HY 676 375 are eleven turf-covered cairns, connected by a turf-covered stony bank, which form an arc around the remains of a large cairn (HY63NE 3) with which they are probably contemporary (one of which was partly excavated by the section revealing two con-joined shortcists each covered by capstones, and formed with built walling on the N and S sides and slabs at the E and W ends, with a slab separating the two cists. Some human bones were found within each cist, but the excavation was abandoned in order to preserve the site.) The cairns vary in size from c5.0m to c10.0m in diameter, and 0.5m to 0.6m in height, and in shape from circular to oval.  The interconnecting bank is spread to c2.0m, and survives to a maximum height of 0.3m. It probably once completely enclosed the cairn (HY63NE 3) but the east side is destroyed by erosion. Towards the N end of the enclosed area are the vague turf-covered footings of a rectangular structure with rounded corners, measuring c8.0m by c3.5m. Its purpose cannot be ascertained.  (For a similar association of large cairn surrounded by smaller cairns and interconnecting bank - see HY45SE19.)  Surveyed at 1/2500.  Visited by OS(NKB) 7 July 1970.   With the object of determining its nature, an exploratory excavation was made into one of these mounds ('A' on plan) by the section with the assistance of Mr R Seatter, of Elsness on 7th and 8th July 1970. The mound was heavily turfed and spread to about 10.0m in diameter with a maximum height of 0.6m, and its surface, although disturbed probably by digging out rabbits, showed no sign of stones. The centre was dug into revealing a content of earth and flat stones apparently laid with a tiled effect evident in the eroded cairn (HY63NE 3). At a depth of c0.4m a roughly rectangular prostrate slab was encountered. It was oriented WNW-ESE and measured 2.5m by 1.1m by 0.1m thick, and proved to be the more easterly of two capstones covering a chamber forming an unusual double cist. The W capstone was a smaller slab which was not fully exposed and left undisturbed. When the main capstone was raised, the chamber oriented WNW-ESE and bisected by a transverse upright slab was revealed, each compartment being full of earth, and obviously never previously disturbed. In order to establish their constructional details both compartments were partially and carefully excavated. The more easterly, measuring 1.35m maximum length by 0.9m maximum width, proved to be full of dry hard packed earth with an admixture of slate-like chips. At a depth of 0.5m a human pelvic bone was exposed, but because of the difficult of removing the hard earth without damaging the bone the excavation of the compartment was abandoned. The position of the bone and the size of the cist suggested that the skeleton was crouched with its head to the W. The W compartment, measuring 1.25m max length by 0.9 m max width was then approached with the object of discovering its depth. The earth content was damp and much softer than in the other compartment, and was mixed with flat stones which had at one time probably fallen from the partly collapsed N wall and also flaked from the underside of the capstone. At a depth of 0.5m several human bones in disarray, some of them broken apparently by the fallen debris, were found with a mass of limpet shells. A fragment of undecorated coarse pottery blackened by fire was also amongst the shells. The remains were obviously in a poor state of preservation, after tracing the S wall to a depth of 0.9m, the excavation",,01/07/1970,31/07/1970

60005,708,964776,EXCAVATION,Full Excavation (1950-),,"ND 3405 8905 Excavations from 20?30 June 2011 concluded work on this large (c11.5m wide by 1.2m high) burial mound. The established trench was extended to the E, to further investigate the partly excavated central stone-lined cist, and to expose the edge of the large central area to the N that was defined by substantial orthostats. This rubble-filled depression was previously thought to represent a large disturbed central cist.Excavations this season revealed that the first phase of the monument consisted of a small stalled Neolithic tomb measuring c3 x 2m internally with six large orthostats forming two opposing pairs of stalls. The tomb was aligned NE?SW with an entrance to the NE (unexcavated). The concentric external stone revetment walls exposed during previous seasons formed the outside of the tomb (c10m in diameter). The large central depression that was partly excavated last season (DES 2010, 132?3) turned out to be the robbed remains of the NW cell, although the inner wall had been removed. The tomb was not fully excavated, this stall was the only part to be investigated to floor level, and no human remains were recovered. A possible posthole was discovered below the robbed internal wall line, perhaps representing a construction marker, and charcoal was recovered for dating. Several cists were inserted into the mound when the Neolithic tomb was backfilled. The cists contained cremation burials and probably date to the Bronze Age. A third cist (c0.80 x 0.49 x 0.62m), which had been inserted into the top of the backfilled tomb entrance, was discovered this season. The cist had previously been disturbed and there was no evidence of a cremation burial. Unburnt human bone was found within the loose backfill, but this could have been incorporated during disturbance.The key discovery this season was the remains of an inhumation burial in the central cist. This relates to the substantial stone constructed square barrow that was built into the mound (DES 2009, 2010). The insertion of this cist involved removing and breaking several large orthostats and cutting into the backfilled Neolithic tomb. The central inhumation had been disturbed, most likely by antiquarians, and only the hands and feet remained in situ. The body was crouched and laid on the left side. The remains of a ?juvenile inhumation, also crouched and placed on the left side, was found outside the central cist to the NE, within a layer of rubble. The unburnt human bone found across the mound, especially in the N cist and around the central cist, was probably derived from these disturbed burials. The remains of the neonate burials found in 2009 to the SW of the central cist could also date to this phase (DES 2009, 141?2). These burial rites and the square barrow architecture suggest that this phase of the monument dates to the Iron Age and possibly the first few centuries AD. The 2011 excavations have confirmed the long history of construction and burial at Roeberry Barrow from the Neolithic to Iron Age, and portray the monument as a significant place for the communities at Cantick for several millennia.Archive: ORCA (currently)Funder: Orkney Islands Council, Scapa Flow Landscape Partnership (HLF) and ORCAORCA, 2011",,2011,2011
60005,709,881211,EXCAVATION,Full Excavation (1950-),,"ND 3405 8905 Excavations from 14?25 June 2010 at Roeberry Barrow (ND38NW 5) continued investigations into the Bronze Age funerary landscape on the peninsula. Last season the large burial mound (c11.5m wide by 1.2m high) was found to contain a complex of central cists setin a sub-circular stone constructed mound. This indicated that the mound had a considerable history of burials along with several phases of structural refurbishment. The most striking of these was when a square outer retaining wall was constructed onto the earlier sub-circular retainingwall, effectively creating a square barrow. The central cists contained the remains of cremation burials; however, there was also evidence for inhumation burials. All the burials had been disturbed by antiquarian activity, but the cist burials would appear to date to the Bronze Age. A decorated rim sherd from a Bronze Age Food Vessel was also recoveredfrom the material to the rear of the later revetment wall. The square barrow refurbishment could be Pictish following a burial tradition found in northern Scotland. This season?s excavations found that the earlier outerwalls consisted of two parallel dry stone built retaining walls forming a large sub-circular structure c10m in diameter. The glacial till had been stripped prior to construction and a slight platform was scalped out of the clay. A thin greyish layer of clay found directly below the walls could represent some form of pre-cairn preparation layer. Extension of thetwo trench quadrants revealed that the area around the mound consisted of glacial till overlain by slumped stony material from the mound. A single oval pit (0.56 x 0.51 x 0.17m) c3m to the NW of the outer retaining wall cut into the glacial till was found to be sterile apart from a single rounded slab.A large rectangular box cist (1.45 x 0.85 x 0.49m) in the SW part of the upper mound was found to contain loose backfill material from antiquarian activity. A cremation burial found in the base was disturbed and pushed to the corners and was overlain with otter sprait. It appears that the cist was open and used as an otter holt before it was disturbed and backfilled by antiquarians. It would appear that this cist represents a Bronze Age insertion rather than a later inhumation burial as suggested in 2009.Excavations in the central area demonstrated that the central cist complex of upright slabs was constructed onto fill material. It is possible that some of these slabs formed a cist for an inhumation burial (perhaps Pictish), but these were not fully exposed and require more investigation. A very large upright slab below the loose material in the western part of the central area appeared to have been broken, perhaps deliberately, during later refurbishment of the mound. This orthostat sat in a large central hollowin the stone constructed core of the mound that may have been lined with walling or upright slabs, since removed. Undisturbed deposits were encountered in the base of the hollow. It is possible that the central part of the mound may have contained burial related structures that were dismantled during later phases of refurbishment. This may have consisted of a large cist or a central burial chamber perhaps dating to the Neolithic. Some human remains were recovered from the upper hollow fill that probably derive from a disturbed inhumation burial; however, none wereencountered in the lower central area. This could suggest that any central burials have been removed or they could remain undisturbed. The central area was not fully excavated. The possibility that the mound started life as a Neolithic burial monument that was later reused in the Bronze Age and the early medieval period highlights considerable longevity of use and significance of place in the funerary practices of the communities in the Cantick area.

60005,711,608691,EXCAVATION,Full Excavation (1950-),,"ND 3405 8905 Excavation on Cantick Head was undertaken, 15?26 June 2009, as part of an ongoing research project into the landscapes of Hoy and Walls. The aim was to investigate a barrow (ND38NW 5) to gain insights into the Bronze Age funerary landscape of the peninsula and to establish if adjacent dykes (ND38NW 6) were related to the barrow. A geophysical survey had shown anomalies within the mound and to the NW (Robertson 2007). The mound was badly damaged by antiquarian excavations although it remains a prominent feature in the landscape. The three grass-covered dykes c2?4.5m wide are located downslope to the E of the barrow. Two run broadly parallel (c20m apart) from the cliff top for c85m with a diagonal dyke linking them. The areahas escaped modern ploughing and the earthworks remain relatively well preserved.The barrow (c11.5 x 1.2m) was investigated in two opposing quadrants. The turf, slumped material and spoilfrom the previous excavation were removed revealing a complex of central cists (not excavated this season) and a secondary box cist (c0.8 x 0.5 x 0.54m internally) of more typical Bronze Age type. This was the only cist to be investigated and contained a disturbed cremation burial and un-burnt human bone. The original stone-built mound c7.5m in diameter was surrounded by a circular stone retaining wall. The mound was later refurbished externally with a square shaped retaining wall which increased the diameter to c8.5m. This secondary external wall was on the same E?W alignment as a large internal rectangular stone built cist (1.45 x 0.85m internally) that appears to have been inserted into the original mound. The cist and square wall are probably contemporary and form a marked change in barrow architecture. The cist had been disturbed and theloose stony layers above contained un-burnt adult human bone and the remains of a neonate. The neonate burial was badly disturbed (with some bones also turning up in the cremation cist) but some skull fragments were apparently in situ above the rectangular cist. This burial could represent a later insertion into the top of the mound. The un-burnt bone found in the excavated cist is likely to derive from mixed antiquarian backfill.Three small trenches were excavated across the linear dykes. They were found to be constructed of turf. Theturfs had been laid grass side down and individual turf lines were visible. The dykes overlay the subsoil and donot appear to be prehistoric sub-peat dykes as previously suggested (ND38NW 6). Test pits were used to investigate the geophysical anomaly to the NW, a platform to the NE and a quarry on the cliff top to the S of the mound. The former two sites were found to be modern in origin and the quarry (6.5 x 3m), complete with tool marks, may have been the source of stone for the original burial mound. It is possible that the square barrow phase dates to the Pictish period when squared burial cairns were constructed in both mainland Scotland and Orkney. However, the style of architecture displayed in the wall and cist, suggest (at this stage) that they represent a complex prehistoric burial sequence that probably dates to the late Neolithic and Bronze Age.The project was run in conjunction with a community training project funded by the Scapa Flow LandscapePartnership (HLF). Local trainees formed part of the excavation team and were trained in field techniques.Archive: ORCAFunder: Orkney Islands Council, Scapa Flow Landscape Partnership (HLF) and ORCADaniel Lee ?

A total of 5ha of gradiometer and 1.2ha of resistivity was completed over six separate areas across the peninsula, to cover the majority of the upstanding monuments. This includedall differing types of sites to assist in the identification of unclear/ unknown site types, to allow for comparative study between similar sites, and to collect data to allow for a wider landscape interpretation to assist in gaining a better understanding of the archaeological development of the peninsula. The results clearly show the broch and associated settlement of Green Hill of Hestiegeo broch (ND38NW 8), while the settlement to the E is obscured by the presence of an igneous dyke. The Outer Green Hill broch (ND38NW 9) mound is certainly artificial but does not now look like a broch. The anomalies indicate midden and structures but they are rectilinear in form. Cantick Farm burnt mound (ND38NW 4) shows up well as a very high magnetic and high resistance anomaly with potentially associated structural elements surviving around it. The Bronze Age barrow (ND38NW 5) at Roeberry is clearly visible with both techniques, while the three earthen dykes to its W do not show up well in either the gradiometer or the resistivity results. Unfortunately the results of the survey of the potential prehistoric mounds atStorehouse and the group at the Ruff of Cantick (ND38NW 17; ND38NW 18; ND38NW 19; ND38NW 16) was inconclusive, with Storehouse having a mix of possible prehistoric and modern origins.Reports to be deposited with the Orkney SMR andRCAHMS.Funder: Orkney Islands CouncilJ Robertson 2007",,2007,2007

There would appear to have been a number of upright stones set at intervals round its margin and three survive on the NE arc.  In 1926, a crofter digging at the base of the most easterly of the upright marginal stones came upon a complete cist, constructed of six thin slabs and measuring 16"" square by 14"" deep. It contained some calcined bones and beside it, a few inches below the ground, was a spatulate polished sandstone implement, 1 1/4"" thick. Further exploration revealed a stone slab having beneath it another slab on which were several hundred small shells placed in a concentric pattern, and a perforated triangular beach-pebble. A more systematic investigation beginning at the entrance ? in the E segment revealed a flagged passage lined with stones to a height of 4' for about half its length. Near the centre of the mound, the passage reached a cist-like construction of stone with a flooring of square slabs but with no cover.

It was further investigated in the 1970's and the results have been published (Hedges 1983, Henshall, 1989). The entrance passage faces seaward and runs to the centre of the chamber. The chamber is 8.2m long and is divided into five segments by four pairs of transversely set orthostats. The two end compartments are structurally distinct from the central portion of the chamber. There are three side cells; two are located off the W side of the central chamber and one lies off the E side. A quantity of human and animal bones were found to have been deposited below the floor of the S end compartment during the construction of the tomb. Analysis of the bone indicated that it comprised the remains of fifteen humans and bones of the white-tailed sea-eagle. Within the central chamber were found the disarticulated remains of 342 individuals, along with charcoal, cremated bone, animal bone and peat ash. The cairn is encased around its W half by a rubble mound, 30m across, which was retained by a semi-circular wall. A forecourt at  E side of the cairn exterior, although damaged by erosion, nonetheless yielded a rich assemblage of artefacts including three stone axes, a mace head a knife and a jet button.

The small orthostat to the NNE survives in situ, but there is no trace of the walling to the SW seen during excavation.  Surveyed at 1:2500.  Visited by OS (IMT) 25 April 1973   Isbister, O-C round with projections:  Since the last report, the cairn has been further excavated in 1976 and 78 by Mr R Simison, the landowner, in collaberation with NoSAS and IAM, revealing much of the chamber and part of the hornwork to the N of the cairn.  The cairn is estimated as about 15m in diameter and still standing c2.9m high. An entrance passage runs from the ENE at right angles to the axis and from the centre of the chamber, and survives for a length of 4m, 0.7m wide, and is still roofed at the inner end by a massive lintel at a height of 0.85m.  The chamber is 8.2m long overall, divided into five segments by three pairs of transversely-set orthostats which project only about 0.1m from the walls and so do not form stalls in the usual manner.The two end compartments are distinct from the central portion of the chamber.  The latter is 6m long by 1.2 to 1.6m wide with drystone walls 2m high without corbelling.  There are three side cells entered from the N and S ends of the W side, and from the N end of the E side of the chamber. The end compartments measure about 1.8m wide by 1.2m deep, thus at ground level are wider than the central portion of the chamber.  Each has a slab set",,01/01/1958,12/12/1958

60031,721,1013765,GROUND SURVEY,N/a,,"HY 22150 12700 (centred on) A walkover survey and subsequent geophysical survey were undertaken, 3?4 March and 2?6 June 2014, in the Nether Mousland area by MSc students from the Archaeology Institute. Nether Mousland is a large deserted farmstead (HY21SW 26) with an additional dwelling (HY21SW 27) and surrounding sub-circular head dyke. This coastal basin landscape had previously received little archaeological attention, apart from the excavation of nearby Bronze Age barrow atMousland in 1990 (HY21SW 6).Evidence for prehistoric activity, which was previously unknown at Nether Mousland, consisted of a large mound within an area of rig and furrow (Site 21) and a burnt mound (Site 19). Site 21 consists of a substantial mound (14.3 x 8.6m) with upright stones protruding from the surface onthe W side. The corners of the mound are horned, and it could be the remains of a substantial burial tomb. There is a depression with loose stone to the W of the main mound.A range of geophysical techniques were undertaken focusing on this potential funerary monument (Site 21), with gradiometer survey extending to cover the mound and sheepfold to the NE (Site 10). Although the results are complicated by later agricultural activity, the combination of earth resistance, gradiometry and GPR suggests that the sub-square mound (Site 21) represents at least two phases of activity although a funerary function is difficult to conclusively identify.The strength and nature of gradiometer data to the NE suggests that the mound (Site 10) that underlies the sheepfold represents an earlier, more substantial site, probably domestic in origin. It is possible that this has medieval or perhaps prehistoric origins. This site is positioned centrallywithin the original head dyke enclosure and could be related. It is likely that there are other prehistoric sites in this area, which has escaped modern agricultural improvements since abandonment in the 1850s.The burnt mound (Site 19) is located next to the Burn of Selta and consists of an oval grass covered mound (12.4 x 7.7m) with a hollow on the S side with protruding upright stones. The Nether Mousland Farmstead (Site 1) is surrounded by a head dyke (Sites 6, 16 and 23), which has been extended on the NE and SE sides (Sites 5 and 17). An additional small farmhouse and enclosure (Site 15) is situated outside the northern head dyke (Site 23) and a possible farmsteadis situated to the E (Site 18) within a later phase of head dyke enclosure (Site 17). The farmsteads are located on the periphery or outside of the original head dyke and could be a later phase of inhabitation (post-medieval?). The dyke contains other field boundaries (Sites 7 and 9) and areas of well defined rig and furrow (Sites 11 and 25). The head dykeappends the larger Mousland Farm dyke to the E, an area which is still cultivated. A large concrete dam across the Burn of Selta, outbuildings (pump house?) and pipeline (Sites 12 and 13) were used during WW2 for a water supply. The scheme failed and was soon abandoned. A substantial mound (Site 14, HY21SW 29) by the Burn of Mousland with numerous circular pits cut into the side was assessed. The mound was found to overlay peat deposits that are visible in the burn cutting and is likely to be modern. It may be associated with works for the WW2 dam (Site 13).The walkover survey recorded 25 sites (No. 8 is void, coordinates are centre points):HY 22066 12622 (Site 21) Prehistoric moundHY 22316 12704 (Site 19) Burnt moundHY 22206 12588 (Sites 1, 2 and 3 ?

The tomb had been inserted into subsoil, possibly a drumlin, on an E-facing hillside. It measured c 3 x 3m and comprised three cells with an entrance, arranged in a clover-leaf formation. The height of the tomb did not exceed 1m. It was constructed of coursed drystone masonry with orthostatic partitions. The wall-heads were corbelled to receive the roof, which was constructed of six large flagstones, found largely intact. The drumlin into which the tomb was constructed was enhanced with stone forming a low cairn of stone with clay. The cairn has not been fully explored, but initial observations indicate it is over 25m in diameter. No revetment walls or external entrance passage have been found in the cairn material. A narrow gap formed between the uppermost roof slab and a notch in the entrance lintel suggest a 'light box'. The exact orientation and function of this feature is still under analysis. The restricted area immediately outside the tomb entrance, formed between the entrance and the cut in the subsoil, was blocked by a series of horizontally laid blocking stones. Matching this on the inside of the tomb, and filling the internal entrance passage, was a tightly fitting but stepped blocking which was inserted from the inside. Preliminary results of the excavation suggest that the internal blocking provided a stepped access from the roof into the tomb interior. The uppermost of the roofing stones had been fitted so that while the tomb was in use it was possible to slide it to one side. After the final use of  the tomb, the roof  was capped by a 40?50cm layer of clay and stone.Deposits within the tomb were minimal. The floor was virtually clean and no artefacts were recovered on it. However, in two cells the remains of four individuals were encountered. The human remains were in an extremely poor condition. Alternating wet and dry conditions may account for the poor preservation. Extensive sampling within the tomb for soil micromorphological analysis has taken place.External to the tomb and also inserted into the cairn material were two cists and one cremation. One cist survived only partially intact as at least one side slab had been previously removed by ploughing. One side of the cist was revetted by a small wall of coursed masonry. Human teeth were the only remains to be found in the deposits within this cist. The second cist had exceptional preservation. It contained the remains of two large deposits of human bone, one of which had been encased in a finely woven basket of plant fibres. Cramp, possibly melted copper and other residues, was also found in the cist. The cist lay at an angle within the cairn material, with one side propped by two leaning stones. It was also capped by two flagstones laid on top of each other, but separated by a vertical stone. The cut within the cairn material was backfilled with loose rubble and some clay.

There were several outstanding questions from the first season. The entrance area of the tomb was complex with its two blockings and the lack of any formal external approach to the tomb. The floor of the tomb and the construction of its walls were also features which demanded further investigation. There was also the question of whether there were other satellite Bronze Age cists, additional to those found previously. Finally, there was the mound the tomb was dug into: was this a man-made or natural feature? Further geophysical work was undertaken in a much wider area around the tomb, but no further cists were located. A hillock in the neighbouring field was also surve",,01/07/1998,31/07/1999

A spread of cramp and cremated material to the S of the remnant mound was also identified. Machine disturbance across the site and the truncation of most of the surviving features had blurred many of the key relationships between the cists and the remnant mound.

Bronze Age funerary structure and house HY 424 138 In the field immediately N of the Late Neolithic settlement of Crossiecrown (HY41SW 154) ploughing revealed several concentrations of stone, investigated initially by fieldwalking. One concentration was associated with cremated bone and a square prehistoric pot. This site, and one close to Ramberry Head were excavated due to the risk from further ploughing. The cremated bone was found to sit on a large flagstone within a sub-rectangular setting of stones, that in turn was surrounded by a carefully arranged surface of beach cobbles. A series of flagstones created a well-defined outer paved kerb to this central setting, c 2.5m in overall diameter. Beyond this was an open clay surface, c 1m wide, that was enclosed by a stone bank, c 2m wide, giving the funerary structure an overall diameter of c 8m. Further cremations were found associated with the central setting. In the second area, the remains of a badly plough-truncated Bronze Age structure was uncovered. This was oval in plan and c 4m in internal diameter, defined by a stone wall up to 2.5m wide. The wall was revetted on either side of a partially paved entrance passage.

60140,734,621089,ORKNEY SMR NOTE,Casual Observation,,"The site is on the south-eastern edge of a shoulder of the hillside, falling away more steeply to the S and E. This shoulder provides a prominent platform at a height of 30 m above ODand 29 m above the Loch of Stenness. Around the cist, a patch of reddish clay soil contrasted with the dark peaty soil of the rest of the field, and a similar patch could be seen 15 m to the N. These patches may represent the sites of tumuli entirely removed by ancient cultivation. Although this land was hill grazing before improvement in the late nineteenth century, it is likely to have been farmland in the remote past; in this part of Orkney much land went out of cultivation during the agricultural depression of the fifteenth century, in the neighbouring parish of Sandwick some 60% of land going out of production.The cover slab of the cist lay at a depth just within the reach of the heavy plough, which struck and displaced it . The southern end of the slab broke off and fell into the the cist, along with a quantity of ploughsoil. The width of the slab exceeded the width of the cist, being 950 mm wide and 990 mm long after the breakage. The cist has its longer axis on a bearing of 162 degrees, i.e. approximately SSE-NNW. The sides are formed of a naturally-flat-surfaced slabs, that forming the E side being 1090 mm long, the W side 1070 mm, the N end-slab 730 mm, and the S end-slab 720 mm. At the SE corner, the E end of the S end-slab was not quite perfectly shaped to give a tright abutment against the E side-slab, and small eke stones had been inserted to fill the gaps. The height of the cist-walls was governed by the height of the two side-slabs, which was not quite matched by the two end-slabs, so at both ends, further eke stones had been used to bring the heights of the end-walls up to the constant height to receive the cover-slab. The two side-slabs and the N end-slab are notably thin, being 30 mm thick, but the S end-slab has a thickness of 90 mm.The baseslab, which rested directly on the underlying natural rock and clay, fitted tightly and precisely within the space defined by the four verticals. It lay at a depth of 580 mm below the underside of the cover-slab, and evidently had been one large slab although now broken up by many fractures. This base-slab however did not extend to the S end of the cist, but was broken across diagonally, and the bottom of the cist at this end was formed by the natural rock. It was on this natural rock surface that the pot had been placed. It appeared that the base-slab may have originally extended all the way to the end, and that the removal of the southern end was a secondary action. As it was, the base-slab stopped short of the S end of the cist by 400 mm on the E side and by 180 mm on the W.Somewhat N of the centre-point of the cist-bottom, the base-slab was marked by a neatly circular dark stain 280 mm in diameter, which possibly marked the position of cremated remains entirely dissolved in the acid soil. It is an alternative possibility however that the original deposition had been removed during a re-use of the cist, when the pot was inserted after the removal of the southern part of the base-slab.Apart fromthe pot, the cist contained nothing except the ploughsoil which fell into its S end at the time of discovery. It was of course inevitable that the part of the cover-slab to break and fall down into the cist should do so directly onto the pot, which seems to have been standing upright close to the S end-slab. Some of the sherds which broke off at that moment, came out with the cover-slab when this was pulled out by the tractor driver and were recovered from the trampled area around the cist, and a few others may not have been found, but the main broken edge of the pot appears to be an old one, as if the pot had been incomplete when deposited.The flagstone bedrock on this shoulder is in places very close to the surface, and advantage seems to have been taken of a weakness in the rock to cut a rec",,01/01/1987,31/12/1987

It is not clear in which of the many barrows here it was discovered but it must have been one of those which are scattered over the top and side of St. Catherine's Hill. The only account of the finding of the torc is contained in (a): ""On these heaths there are many barrows, of which I have opened three. In the first the layers of turf were perfectly preserved in slices, one upon another, and on reaching the level the body was clearly delineated in black bone-dust. In the second the ashes were in a vase of unbaked pottery, and in the third there was only a beautiful twisted bracelet of solid gold"". That these barrows were at Blackwater is known from a label preserved with the bracelet at Heron Court. (1)The large size of the barrows (possibly those at SZ 19 NW 19) and the B.A. evidence from the other two opened at the same time suggest EBA contracted burial. (2) No information was gained during recording or fieldwork to enable the barrows in which these finds were made to be identified.

He records its diameter as 32ft., and its height as 2ft. 6in. Five urns were found, all in the south-western half. These comprise two bucket urns which have been restored, and three fragmentary specimens, all probably of bucket or barreltype. The barrow lay right on the line of Hillbrow Road and almost exactly half way along it, and when the road was made up in the following July and the ground prepared for building, at least thirty-four urns came to light, and probably some twelve more of which nothing has survived. The smaller barrow, about 24ft. across and only 1ft. Gin. high, lav some 50 yards to thesouth-west and near to the railway bridge.

The cist, which was found to hold a crouched adult male, was set within a cairn over an earlier small mound that was largely comprised of sand, stone and midden material. The mound in turn was found to overlay an earlier land surface. The site was not completely excavated but a section was cut across it so that its construction sequence and relationship with the cist could be better understood. In an attempt to stabilise the site, the upstanding section was subsequently reburied beneath the spoil from the excavation however, it is recognised that the site will in time be lost to coastal erosion. A radiocarbon date on bone from the skeleton fell between 1380 and 1110 cal BC, providing a Middle Bronze date, a time from when there are very few human remains known from Cornwall and no other barrow-associated burials are currently recorded.",,01/10/2007,31/10/2007

73000,1450,ECO3569,Watching Brief,Partial Investigation,North Cornwall STW pipeline mitigation,"In 2009, the Historic Environment Projects team (Cornwall Council) was commissioned by South West Water Ltd to undertake archaeological recording in mitigation of the impact of the construction of a 5.5 km long STW pipeline (Figs 1-4), running from Boscastle (SX 0951 9080) to Tintagel (SX 0531 8851). Following an archaeological assessment and the results from a geophysical survey, a programme of archaeological recording was carried out along the route of the pipeline. The programme of archaeological recording included controlled soil strips in those areas where there was thought to be high potential for buried archaeology. This included fourteen stretches of the pipeline and the five compounds. A watching brief was also carried out along the remainder of the pipeline corridor (Figs 1-4). The mitigation work identified a series of archaeological finds and features spanning the last 10,000 years, which included a Mesolithic flint working site at Gavercoombe Farm (Tintagel); approximately 31 prehistoric pits; a probable standing stone within a ditch at Trethevey; a possible standing stone at Bossiney; a Beaker cist or stone-lined pit close to California Quarry (Forrabury cliffs); a cist or stone-lined box at Trevalga; a prehistoric field system of probable Bronze Age date at Bossiney_; a Late prehistoric/early medieval cist grave cemetery at Forrabury; an early medieval cist grave and other structures at Tintagel. In addition ditches, boundaries, and other features dating from the medieval, and post-medieval periods were also recorded. The excavation of a prehistoric roundhouse at Trevalga is covered by a separate report. A possible Bronze Age cairn north of Gavercoombe Farm (Tintagel) was also discovered, although this lay outside of the pipeline corridor and was not further investigated. The archive report is the first stage in a programme of post excavation analyses which will lead to publication.",,07/05/2009,31/03/2010

This followed on from an earlier phase of evaluation undertaken by Wessex Archaeology in 1986 (4). The barrow is one of two barrows previously 'lost' in the 19th century (5). The excavation revealed that there were four major phases to the barrow construction. The initial phase comprised two rectangular graves surrounded by a discontinuous circular ditch and covered by a small mound. One grave contained the disarticulated remains of an adult male and a child, the other those of an adult male, adult female and a foetal or neonatal infant. The bones of the individuals  were carefully separated  within the graves. The burials had apparently been contained in timber structures, represented by vertical faces to the packing around the edges of the graves and by slumped mound material towards the centres. The mound was enlarged three times, the first enlargement incorporating concentric arcs or circles of stakes. Two burials post-dated the initial ones but could not be attributed to any particular phase of enlargement: the articulated remains of a young adult male accompanied by cattle bones and an barbed and tanged flint arrowhead, and the cremated remains of an adult contained in a Collared Urn and accompanied by a copper alloy knife dagger.A series of small pits were cut into the edge of the barrow. A single isolated grave was cut into the eastern edge of the barrow mound and may be Romano-British in date. The ditch of a trackway of probable Roman date also cut the edge of the barrow.",,01/06/1988,31/08/1988

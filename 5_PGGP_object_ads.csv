A small area has broken away from the bottom right-hand corner, a crack and dent along the bottom of the tag, deforming the bottom edge inwards and a break on the top of the pendant where the top edge is rolled over. Both areas of damage happened in antiquity and the pendant was bent before it was buried.

Investigation by microscope, scanning electron microscope (SEM), and infra red spectroscopy was carried out by Laura Ratcliffe.

10171,10023,FCO2306,Pot,,URN,167,Pot,Trevisker,"Quinnell 2011: 95 <The vessel belongs to the Trevisker tradition. About 40% of it appears to have been present. The weight of the surviving sherds is 2534 g. It had been approximately 330 mm high with a rim diameter of c. 220 mm (Fig. 5). Few rim sherds are present and few from the upper part of the decorated zone below the rim. The out-turned rim is very much worn on its outer edge; some of this wear could have been caused by contact with the covering slate but that on the outside of the rim suggests wear during use. The decoration was produced by incisions on a well burnished surface: these incisions form lines of c. 12 close-spaced chevrons. Insufficient of the vessel survives from immediately below the zone of decoration for the presence of small lugs or dimples, sometimes found in this position, to be ascertained. A residue of black carbonaceous matter coats the lower 120 mm of the interior. The edges of surviving sherds are not fresh. However there had obviously been considerable surface water penetration and this apparent abrasion is probably due to factors of bioturbation. The vessel was fired in oxidising conditions; the matrix is yellowish red (5YR 5/6) but the exterior patchily reduced, ranging from brown (10 YR 3/2) to dark grayish brown (10 YR 3/2). Roger Taylor examined both sherds and a thin section and identified the fabric as gabbroic from the Lizard in south Cornwall. Basaltic rock fragments had been added to the gabbroic clay and these probably derived from pillow lavas which outcrop on Mullion Island and on the northern margin of the Lizard Complex. The vessel is likely, therefore, to have been made somewhere in this area of the Lizard. The fabric is generally permeated by calcium carbonate, presumably as a result of the environment in which it was deposited.  The state of the vessel when deposited in the pit is uncertain as much had disappeared in cliff falls. It must have been complete around most of its circumference when buried as an upright container ",N/a,Fragment(s),Worn,Upright,Direct,Container of body,,,,Pottery,"73553, 73554, 73555, 73556, 73557",Unknown,,,,393

These typical features on the Broadmayne beaker are:- the zonal styling in multiple zones fused together only on the neck; the simple positive motifs; the use of fringing triangles on the neck zone; the absence of floating motifs; the crisp neck definition and shape. In some of these features the beaker is even archaically reminiscent of the Primary Southern beakers (S1) which are confined to East Anglia and Yorkshire.

The widely accepted view that Food Vessels occurred alongside the main floruit of Beaker pottery is once again confirmed by this result. Significant here is the fact that the decorative motif of incised diamonds is also common to Beaker pottery. The Food Vessel from Saltwood Tunnel (Fig. 2.9, No. 1) was also warped with large firing cracks. Most of these misfired vessels were recovered from sepulchral contexts. The Food Vessel from Saltwood (Fig. 2.9, No. 1) is a southern bipartite vase. This has very minimal decoration emphasising the upper part of the vessel, which is quite typical of vessels from southern and eastern England (see examples in Clarke 1970). The decoration consists of two rows of horizontal zig-zag, formed of triple incised lines, that overlap to make a diamond pattern. Similar motifs are not only found on Food Vessels but also on Beakers of Clarke’s S4 group (eg 1970, nos 1018, 1034 and 1036). >The Food Vessel at Saltwood was placed just behind the skull ",N/a,Almost complete,Damaged,Upright,Direct,Head,Placed behind skull - note this is a wonky mis-fired pot!

Only two maceheads have been found in graves in Orkney, making this an exceptionally rare discovery.This macehead is one of the most exquisite prehistoric artefacts from Orkney, demonstrating precise craftsmanship and a fine surface polish, even within the perforation. The highly banded rock is Lewisian Gneiss that must have been imported to Orkney from the north west coast of Scotland or the Outer Hebrides.This macehead was donated to Stromness Museum in 1838, within a year of the founding of the Orkney Natural History Society.

The pot is made of a brown-red fabric, medium hard and with a, grey-black core in the breaks, and tempered with a fairly even scattering of grits. The rather worn external surface varies in colour from a patchy red-orange and buff to a dirty brown-red; internally the surface is smooth, light iron  brown and patchily coated with a whitish residue.The decoration is of alternate plain and patterned zones encircling the body; seven, possibly eight, bands occur, consisting of a series of horizontal lines made with comb impressions. The impressions are poor in quality and generally indistinct, particularly near the base, where the lines are worn and smudged. The best series come from the first band of four lines just beneath the rim. Working down the pot, the next five zones are all evenly spaced and made up of four lines, except for the second which has five-the untidy overlap in the sixth zone is probably an attempt at repeating this. Finally comes the seventh band with only two rough lines, and possibly a very faint single line for the last. The average length of the comb used in decorating the vessel is from 2-2·5 in.

The brooch only has one tab and the end of the pin is divided to accommodate it, hinged on a short rod or rivet with large neatly rounded ends. Under the foot is a short solid catch-plate. The centre of the brooch is ornamented with a large rounded knob of coral attached by a bronze rivet. There are three similar but smaller coral settings supported on the trefoil head and three others, smaller still on the foot (one lost). Under one of the knobs is some original black adhesive that has been identified as a resin. The cast decoration around the central coral knob is quite simple: at the head is a device of two attached triangular shapes each with a tendril springing from opposed corners, the one terminating in a keeled tendril, the other more rounded. At the foot is an elongated hourglass shape with a lip-motif, on either side is a raised dot.Adams (2013) Brooch no. 10002; Mill Hill, Burial, grave 112.; Condition incomplete; Type/subtype: 2B/2Bb; Probable prod. date (BC): 280-175; Materials: Tin Bronze, n/a, Coral.

It is of a simple, almost hemispherical design, although oval in plan, with shallow-angled projecting neck-guard at the rear. It appears to have been beaten from a single sheet of copper alloy.  It is likely that the helmet was complete when it was deposited. Three main areas of damage - a large, irregular hole at the peak of the helmet, a broken/dented section of rim, and cracking and splitting around the sides and towards the back of the helmet, are almost certainly caused by post-depositional factors.The bowl of the helmet is smooth, plain and undecorated. There are two parallel lines of cabled decoration running around the circumference of the helmet; one follows the edge, while the other runs above it, following the line of the bowl. There is a single circular hole pierced through each side of the helmet, between these bands of decoration. This type of helmet was not normally fitted with cheek-pieces (Pernet 2010, 116; Robinson 1975, 29), so it is most likely that these holes were intended for the attachment of a chin-strap. There is an additional square hole somewhat crudely pierced through the decoration on the neck-guard of the helmet. This may have been used as a third point of attachment for the chin-tie, or possibly for the attachment of a carrying-ring.Measurements: Circumference around rim, including neck-guard, and incorporating areas of damage: 665mm; weight: 539.4g.",N/a,Complete,Unknown,Inverted,Direct,Container of body,,Y,,Bronze/Cu Alloy [Copper Alloy],71303,Unknown,,KENT-FA8E56,https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/526999,939

It has a symmetrical two-coil spring and external chord. Although the majority of the brooch is in good condition, the catchplate is damaged.

It is made from a small piece of copper alloy sheet rolled into a simple point. The spike shares the same greenish patina as the helmet, and it seems likely that it was associated with the helmet in some way. As it does not appear to relate directly to any of the three holes pierced through the rim of the helmet, it is possible that it fitted somehow into the damaged area at the top. Nevertheless, this interpretation is problematic, and cannot be demonstrated with any certainty. Helmets of the type used in this burial were not normally fitted with knobs, spikes or crests, nor is this spike of the same design as those sometimes used to adorn other types of contemporary helmet. If this piece had been used to adorn the top of the helmet, it would have been a very unusual modification. It is equally possible that the spike is unrelated to the helmet, or served a different, unknown, purpose.Measurements: Total length: 27.1mm; maximum width at base: 12.9mm; weight: 1.8g.",N/a,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Direct,Mixed with body parts,With cremated bone within helmet,,,Bronze/Cu Alloy [Copper Alloy],71303,Unknown,,KENT-FA8E56,https://finds.org.uk/database/artefacts/record/id/526999,939

Originally they would all have been roughly the same size – c. 75 mm in diameter and with central hole c. 10 mm in diameter. The discs were decorated with a geometric linear design featuring concentric circles and some were filled with zigzag or wavy motifs.

It should be noted that  immature  dog and fox bones  are morphologically very similar and, in the case of a single bone, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion about the species present. The bird remains included red grouse (Lagopus scoticus), teal (Anas crecca), kitti  wake (Rissa tridactyla), guillemot (Uria aalge), snipe (Gallinago gallinago ), gannet (Sula bassana) and greylag goose (Anser anser). Fish was represented by a single cod (Gadus morhua) premaxilla.O'Sullivan in Barber et al 1996 notes that: this material may represent either creatures that used the cairn for nesting or remains which were deposited in the cairn by predators and carrion-eaters. This explanation may account for the wide range of faunal remains from the disturbed, partly vacuous body of the cairn, but is less likely to be true of the sheep, vole, dog/fox and wildfowl bones which were sealed by the central cist. These - with the possible exception of the rodent bones - may have been deliberately deposited prior to construction of the cist. This could be asserted with more confidence if the bones were burnt.

Some smaller sherds had a 'honeycomb' texture when observed in profile, due to the loss of their organic temper, and warping had rendered the fabric unstable. These characteristics appear to be secondary, possibly the result of refiring on the cremation pyre, and may account for the partial recovery of the vessel.

Many steatite funerary vessels are highly burnt and falling apart from placement in the intense heat of a pyre (Sharman in prep), but that is not the case with SF18, which presents evidence that  it  was  used in a domestic setting prior to its burial. The thin burnt lining may be the result of sealing the vessel to reduce its porosity, overlain by thick accretions from cooking foodstuffs. The condition of the vessel indicates that it had been used on a ﬁre several times, with burnt material entering the cracks that gradually appeared from such use, similar to the fragments from the settlement site of Tofts Ness, Sanday (Smith in prep).

Ten rim sherds are present. Many of these conjoin and make up perhaps some 90% of the vessels original rim diameter, estimated at approximately 12cm. Additional conjoining body sherds suggest that nearly all of the circumference of the vessel may be present. The fractured remains of a single small, sub-rounded 'lug' or perhaps lug-handle attachment (at least 15mm in diameter and standing 7mm proud of the surface) exists on one of the rim sherds. At least 6 sherds show the signs of a slight carination at the shoulder of the vessel. A part-profile which runs to a depth of 72mm below the rim and includes the shoulder carination has been established.No base sherds have been identified with certainty.The fabric of the vessel is a moderately sanded-clay of fine to medium-sized, mostly clear, quartz-sand; though some very occasional rose quartz was also noted. The clay had been tempered with moderate amounts of small and relatively angular fragments of grog. The inner and outer surface colours varied in patches from light buff to black, the inner surface was mostly blackened. Two-tone firing (where different internal and external colours meet at the core of the vessel) was evident on many sherds. The surfaces had been smoothed-over and the rim was simple but neatly flattened. Clay displaced by the rim-forming process could be seen on the internal face of the vessel.This vessel should date to the Early Bronze Age c. 2000-1500 BC. The carinated profile might suggest an affinity with the Collared and Cordoned urns of this period, though the presence of the 'lug' is unusual. No other vessels of this date from Thanet are known to feature a lug of this type; such additions are more commonly found on Middle Bronze Age Deverel-Rimbury type vessels.",N/a,Almost complete,Unknown,Unknown,Direct,Head,By the head,,,Pottery,71543,Unknown,,,,

It is uncertain whether it once held the remains or simply accompanied them. The fabric could have been made from local resources (Barclay 2006, 47).The vessel has been irregularly formed with a variable rim curvature. The rim was also uneven on the interior and the wall thickness varied. On the whole the vessel gave the impression of being hurriedly constructed. Both the external and internal surfaces of the vessel had been wiped, possibly with some form of textile. Small patches of soot were also visible on both the interior and exterior surfaces. The irregularity of the form suggests that the time available to form the vessel may have been limited.

On this gently arched foot-disc are corroded traces of engraved pattern, like that on the Islip brooch, but too fragmentary to make coherent. The pinhinge mechanism shows an early stage in development from the simple coiled spring ... the end of the bow has been cast with a knopped loop and a back projection against which the pin presses on closing: the pin has been wound separately outside this loop in two turns with external chord, the whole being lined with a bronze cylinder.Potentially among the earliest of the involute brooches known of in Britain at the time (they dated it to c. 200 BC)Adams (2013) Brooch no. 10516; Trevone, Burial Grave in cliff edge.

Four settings of vitreous material fixed in an oval of whitish composition were placed diagonally round this dome. Two survive: one is a small strip of blue glass, its structure (seen under a hand-lens) suggesting it has been splintered longitudinally from a broken glass bracelet ... The matrices of the two missing settings suggest that they were similar; the other surviving setting, however, appears to be an irregular lump of striated red enamel (it is of cuprous oxide in a lead silicate glass), and may be a replacement ... The head of the disc projects into a tongue lapping up onto the bow, and a swelling out of the bow under the tongue (and breaks in the corrosion of its top surface) suggest that a rivet has joined this tongue end of the disc-foot to the bow.Adams (2013) Brooch no. 10633; Trevone, Burial Grave in cliff edge.

In Cornish Bronze Age Pottery, Part I, this cup, being then unavailable for inspection was sketched from the published illustration in which it appears to have a foot-ring owing to being placed on a stand for photographic purposes.

Group 1 Miniature cup The decoration is in three bands divided by incised lines, the uppermost, just below the rim, has a design of plaited cord which changes half-way round to incised triangles enclosing a single dot. The second band has two or three incomplete rows of twisted single cord impressions. The broadest band, stretching to the bottom of the handle, is composed of diamond shapes of incised lines variously decorated inside with small irregular stabs. Although it has no foot-ring it has the pointille decoration of the Aldbourne cups and in spite of its beaker-like paste it is definitely not a Beaker as it accompanied a cremation.

Very close to it were two unburnt bonesVery highly decorated and also handle decorated. Divided into 5 zones and all but basal area decorated. Infilled diamonds and diagonal lines . Handled made to look like basketry  Beaker as past reference The rather flat handle as compared to good round-bodied handles, and the rather coarse decoration and clumsy shape, may be signs of typological devolution, possibly but not certainly an indication of late date. The diamond pattern occurs on handled beakers in the Midlands, but such parallels have only general and not special significance. The decoration has plainly been arranged to suit the shape. The inbent rim of this beaker  ppears to be a characteristic developed in Britain, perhaps first on handled beakers, though it occurs on beakers without handles, including two of those from Cornwall, Praa Sands (Patchett, 1946, 23) and Tregiffian Vean (Patchett, 1953). The other beaker sherds are all acceptable as belonging to the ‘A’ group in respect of fabric, technique of decoration and the pattern of running chevrons which is quite common in south-west England, occurring for example on the Praa Sands beaker.165mm tall and 150mm mouth diameter Clarke 1970: 477.

The small fragments of  root embedded in this piece of bone proves on examination under the binocular microscope to have no parent root canal at all, and perhaps the most likely explanation is that it is a retained apex from a shed deciduous tooth. The two broken teeth are equally difficult to identify. In one of them, the broken crown flares out from the root at an angle almost too extreme even for a deciduous tooth.

Its inner surface was blackened by contact with hot ash and it contained soil and charcoal and some fragments of unidentified carbonized organic material Christie 1960: 83 <Urn I (fig. 4, PL xv). This was found virtually intact, inverted over a heap of ash and charcoal in a shallow pit dug into the subsoil and covered by the turf stack. It had been packed round with horizontally laid slate slabs, but the base, which was broken, was unprotected. This urn, unlike Urn II, contained no soil and it would seem that the break occurred shortly before discovery (the fracture looked fresh) probably due to the pressure and vibration during the excavation. The contents, predominantly charcoal and ash, were washed and some minute fragments of a black vesicular substance were found. The urn is of softened biconical form, 350mm high, with an internally bevelled rim (diam. 292mm—crushed out of shaped), two handles springing from mouldings on the shoulder and tapering to a narrow base 5.5 inches in diameter. The paste, which is laminated and friable, contains some grit and shows a red outer and black inner fracture. The light brown exterior of the pot is smoothed, the upper portion being blackened with ash and charcoal on the outside as well as inside. The decoration, carefully executed in rather coarse twisted cord, is confined to the rim, neck and mouldings. It consists of two rows of impressed cord around the top of the neck, a broad band 3 inches deep with inch-wide panels infilled with diagonal 'hatching' in cord, and two further rows of cord below.

73895,76403,,Pot,,,167,Pot,Trevisker,"inverted Style I Trevisker vessel. The soil fill of the pit contained three and a half biconical terracotta beads (1.1cm in length), a small clay cone 3.2cm tall with an oval base (also inside Urn II) , two calcined flakes, a discoidal quartz pebble, and traces of calcined bone. As with Urn 1, this urn also had a burned interior, and mourners had covered its base with a slate slab. The funerary participants covered these deposits and enlarged the mound with a 10.6 m in diameter. Christie 1960: 85 < bevel with two single rows of cord.Urn II (fig. 4, PL xiv). This was inverted over a shallow pit in a similar manner to Urn I, on the northern periphery of the turf mound. A slate slab had been laid over its base, which had broken in antiquity, and the urn was filled almost to the top with soil; this on examination was found to contain some very small fragment  of calcined bone (aver. c. I inch square)—not enough to represent a human cremation. There was scant trace of ash or charcoal in or around the urn, but its interior was blackened and had clearly once held ashes. The urn, which is of similar paste to Urn I, is larger, heavier and more pronouncedly biconical (rim diam. 390mm, height 400mm ). The decoration is executed in a three-cord plait and consists of three rows of impressed cord, a band 3I inches deep of neat vertical chevrons—the cord being used as a stamp wound over a suitable flat-ended object about \ inch wide. Two rows of cord on either side of the slight moulding at the shoulder terminates the decorated zone; on PI. xiv it can be seen that the cords overlapped rather than meeting exactly. The handles (3 inches wide where they spring from the shoulder, but 2 inches wide elsewhere) are nearly an inch thick and bear the same decoration as the body of pot.

It is biconical and has only a thickening or very slightly defined cordon where grooves  enerally occur. The base is thick, rising to the centre and in some places pinched, the vessel being asymmetrical in outline, the internal bevel is narrow. The great height above the cordon recalls the vessel from Bushmills, Dublin.2 The nearest analogies are a food vessel from Arghfarrel and Ridgeway Hill, Dorset.4 The paste is thick and very heavy containing a large amount of rather small grit. The surface is rough and of a texture common in Cornwall at the end of the Middle Bronze Age. In colour it varies from red to brown and has a black core. The decoration is of fingernail impressions arranged in columns from rim to base, with deliberate breaks in the design stressing a probable Irish origin. The nail marks have obviously been made by a small hand with very long nails. This form of ornament, without parallel in  ornwall, is found both in Scotland and Ireland. One food-vessel from Darnhalls, Peebleshire, has horizontal nail marks while on one from Muirkirk they are in columns.

10095,76474,,Weaponry,,,82,Dagger,Flat Riveted,"The Rosecliston finds constitute a 'dagger-grave' beneath some kind of barrow. The cremation of an adult male, accompanied by pyre material, was associated with an extremely worn bronze(?) dagger of atypical form, perhaps related to the Harlyn Barrow III dagger and of mid- or late Wessex date; and an urn which is an outstanding example of the former Patchett Class B ribbon-handled group. The urn, linked by its decorative motifs with Urn I from the nearby Liskey barrow, a barrow which independently may be of early Wessex date, possesses a number of Longworth's primary traits and may thus be early within its own class. These considerations suggest a date no later than Wessex II - on present thinkng, the fifteenth century B.C. for the Rosecliston finds, cremation and barrowKnife-dagger. Dagger is 80mm long and apparently very worn according to Dudley and Thomas. Said to be of atypical form but may be realted to Camerton-Snowshill types. Dudley and Thomas 1965: 11 <It has the remains of a tapering, roughly triangular blade, of uncertain length since at no point does the original perimeter survive, a shallow midrib which expands slightly at the top of the blade, and an expanded heel whose original shape is lost. There are two widely-spaced rivets, each about 6 mm. in diameter and thus to be classed as 'broad' or 'thick'. The metal is presumably bronze. There are no signs of any grooves or lines parallel to the original edges of the blade.>Note however that Jones and Quinnell (2013: 171) state that <The blade is in poor condition and much of the edge is missing. Although it was suggested (Dudley & Thomas 1965) to have become worn at the time of burial, what is left of the blade suggests that it was  symmetrical and so not significantly worn when buried>",N/a,Almost complete,Worn,On side,Direct,On top of body,,,,Bronze/Cu Alloy [Bronze],73424,Royal Cornwall Museum,,,,379

The urn contained the poor cremation of a small adult and two flint flakes, and was associated with other flakes and pebbles. The urn had been tightly enclosed by the slabs, and its base had been removed possibly to allow the cremation deposit to be poured into it. The sloping stone in the centre of the barrow was surrounded by ashes and charred wood, and beneath it was a cartload of ashes. Two flint flakes were found within these.Although one could argue for truncation of base by plough etc, this urn was placed very far down in mound and was sealed by a undisturbed capstone so could not have lost its base from plough Did they forget to put the cremated bone into the urn and then could not get it back out as it was tightly packed?

Relationship to burial not recorded exactly but in this cist Oldham 1988: 135 <A label with the dagger gives Croft Andrew's address and the year 1942. It notes that the dagger was 'in six fragments, including one of the three rivets (detached)'. Croft Andrew sent it to the British Museum for onservation by Dr H.J. Plenderleith in 1942 (Fig 85). The method which he used has removed the corrosion products and it is not certain how much of the original shape and size of the object has been lost. What exists today comprises two parts: most of the blade, including two rivets, and the tip, part of which has been lost. The dagger blade is 110mm long, 34mm wide (max) and 3.8mm thick (max). It is made of copper alloy, as are the two rivets. Much of the edge of the blade has been lost due to corrosion although the basic outline would appear to be representative of the original shape. There is a slight midrib which follows the blade outline and has a maximum width of 13.5mm. The hilt end of the blade is badly affected by corrosion and it is not certain what of three rivets. The two which remain have a diameter of 4mm and the length of the longest is 9.1mm. The line of the grip plate is not visible. If what remains is indicative of the original form of the dagger it is an example of a knifedagger with mid-rib (Gerloff, 1975, 168-70). Such daggers are invariably associated with cremation burial under a barrow; a fact which supports the association of this dagger with the urn and barrow. This is the first record of such a dagger coming from Cornwall. Pearce (1983, 367) notes only three in south-west Britain and that from Priddy has most similarity to the Fore Down example. The Priddy dagger is set by Pearce within her Plymstock-Wessex 2 phase, the equivalent of the Arreton phase in the south-east. Of the six other Cornish daggers listed by Pearce five are of the Camerton-Snowshill type, which she also sets in the same phase. The  oncentration of all except one of the Cornish daggers within a circle of only 20 km radius is noteworthy. This small area must have been of some import during the currency of such daggers and it is tempting to see a connection between the show of wealth which these daggers represent and the rich metal resources of the area. The Fore Down dagger fits in well with the social scenario developed by Pearce (1983, 274 — 9).",N/a,Fragment(s),Worn,On side,Unknown,Unknown,With urned cremation but no further detail ,,,"Bronze/Cu Alloy [Copper Alloy], Wood (Uncertain/Unspecified)",73495,Royal Cornwall Museum,,,,1307

The decoration comprises two rows of opposed horseshoe motifs executed in twisted cord, one row above and the other below the slight carination. These zones are defined by horizontal lines of twisted cord impres  sions, one below the horseshoe motifs and two just below the rim of the vessel. The internal rim bevel is similarly adorned with two horizontal lines of twisted cord decoration. In the damaged area of the cup (which is not shown in the illustrat ion) there are traces of two circular perforations, bored before firing and located on the line of maximum diameter between the two rows of horseshoe motifs. They are each of 3mm diameter and lie 0.8mm apart. The soft pinky-buIT and grey fabric is tempered with fragments of orange and buIT grog ranging in size from 1 to 3mm in length or diameter. No rock inclusions are present.The vessel belongs to the class of pygmy cups which occurred widely throughout Britain during the Early Bronze Age period. They commonly possess a biconical form and perforations within their body walls. Decoration is profuse, and usually incised, but impressed techniques are also well represented (Mega w and Simpson 1979, 238). The Early Bronze Age dating is suggested by fairly common associations with other classes of grave good and by a few radiocarbon dates. The Colliford cup belongs to Abercromby's original category 4 of miniature vessels which are described by him as 'biconical with everted lip' ( Abercromby 1912, volume II, 24-37). These vessels are related to the more specific classes of miniature vessel, grape cups and Aldbourne cups, which were associated with the contemporary rich barrow burials in Wessex. In particular, the pairs of circular horizontal perfora t ions, as found on the Colliford vessel , can be matched on cups of the Aldbourne type (Ashbee 1960, 127- 8). These double perforations may represent ritual oculi motifs.>",N/a,Complete,Unknown,Inverted,Indirect,Other,placed in turf stack/mound directly above pit cremation - relationship is confirmed by Woodward as likely intentional ,,,Pottery,74156,Unknown,,,,1448

He also notes that a few fragments of bone and a fair quantity of charcoal (none of which has survived) — some of it within the pot base — were associated with the pot, which was in a bad 'mushy' state and difficult to remove.' (Christie 1988, 118)'So much of the pot remains that it must have been complete until disturbed, only the upper part being much damaged. It is described by Croft Andrew in his 1942 synopsis: 'A lightly moulded base is in evidence, with some well turned contours on the wall, but the rim is in doubt. The conception of the form far outstrips the execrable potting and the plentiful but infantile ornament of scored chevrons and horizontal lines'. More prosaically, it may be classed as a Late Beaker of Clarke's (1970) Final Southern group or Lanting's and Van der Waals' (1972) step 7.

The upper part was amissing, and the part of the body remaining was full of cracks.The urn, which was made of very dark, friable ware, had to be removed piecemeal, but though several fairly large fragments were got out, their edges were so crumbly that they could not be fitted together. When complete the vessel must have been a large one, of flower-pot shape, with a wide base. As it lay in its cavity it measured internally [22 cm] across the base, and [28 cm] in height on the best preserved side. At this height an internal diameter of nearly [38 cm] was indicated. The wall measured [3 cm] in thickness and the base [4 cm].

A fusiform bead was found next to the sacrum in Cluster 3, and a chunky rectangular bead was found beneath a thigh bone (femur) in Cluster 2.The fusiform bead is circular in cross-section at its widest point and has angled ends, their slope due partly to the ancient loss of material around the perforation at either end (Illus 22 & 23). Almost all the surface has been polished to a high sheen, and where the sheen is less intense (on one side, at the broadest point), there are very faint traces of multidirectional striations that relate to the shaping of the bead by abrasion. The overall impression is that this was an old and worn bead when buried (Sheridan in Lelong 2018, 40).The chunky bead is roughly rectangular, both in plan and cross-section, with one squared-off end and one partly squared-off end. It has a longitudinal perforation, drilled from both ends. At one end the borehole appears double and the second perforation extends only part of the way into the bead; this attests to the initial mis-positioning of the drill. The bead’s two broadest sides have been polished to a high sheen, obliterating virtually all traces of the grinding striations that had resulted from its shaping, while one of the narrow sides has just been polished to a low to medium sheen, insufficient to remove the faint traces of numerous longitudinal grinding striations. The other narrow edge has a pocked, ‘orange peel’-like appearance, with a large, natural, oval dimple near one end (see below.) An attempt has been made to polish this surface, but with little success. All of one end, and most of the other, is matte. There are signs of thread-wear: the edges of the perforations are worn smooth, and at either end there is a possible thread-groove.Among the sand that became caked in the bead’s perforation is a short length of thin organic material. Analysis has established that it is sinew, and this may well have been the thread on which the bead had been strung. Small fragments of similar material were also found in the fusiform bead’s perforation. It is impossible to say whether the two beads had originally formed part of a single piece of jewellery, although this possibility should be borne in mind (Sheridan in Lelong 2018, 42).",N/a,Unknown,Worn,Unknown,Direct,Mixed with body parts,,,,"Jet/Lignite/Shale/Coal [Jet], Sinew",74330,Unknown,,,,

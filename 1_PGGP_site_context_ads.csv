Excavation revealed a circular hut and a complex of many post holes and shallow pits surrounded by a curving gully. Various finds were recovered along with two infant burials.,"TQ 5235 6498 Late Iron Age farmstead excavated between 1966 and 1969 by the Crayford Manor House Archaeological Group. Excavation revealed a circular hut and a  complex of many post holes and shallow pits surrounded by a curving gully.  (1) The enclosure was found to be bounded by a substantial fence. Outside this on the uphill side of the site only, ran the shallow drainage gully. The interior seems to have been divided, each division with a specialised function. Over 340 shallow pits and post holes were recorded, which bear no relationship to each other. It is therefore possible that they represent a number of simple structures frequently rebuilt in the same area. Stratification indicated three possible phases of occupation.  (2) A large quantity of Iron Age B and C pottery was recovered. The discovery of Iron Age B pottery puts back the date of occupation to perhaps c100 BC. The site was indicated by Lt Col Meates at TQ 52416504, which lies upon the southern end of a chalk downland ridge.  He stated that the site, which is still being excavated, has been dated to the 1st C BC -1st C AD, but a full report will be published in due course. The excavation so far reveals a number of postholes and storage pits cut into the chalk. Site surveyed at 1:2500.  Two human infant burials were also found.

[See plans AO/64/105/2-3-4] Three Roman phases followed a pre-Roman occupation evidenced by calcined grains and traces of straw below the foundations. Several cwts. of pottery, five identifiable bronze coins dating from the 1st to 4th.C.,others unidentifiable, tesserae (nearly all red brick), etc., were found. A second building, of considerable size, but not completely excavated was found 20 yds. to the south. [See plan AO/64/105/5]. Jessup refers to the site as ""the Northfleet villa site"" but Taylor considers ""the walls uncovered appear from the plan to represent an industrial building, rather than a dwelling house, but they probably belong to more than one building and are of various ages"".

(6 to 7)There was no direct evidence for pre-Roman occupation although late iron age pottery was found in association with Roman pottery.  Similarly there was no direct evidence for post-Roman occupation of the area although sherd of early medieval pottery was found around the villa area.(8-10)Extensive investigation at the site has truncated or destroyed much of the complex so that in many places wall footings rarely survive beyond a base layer of cobbles.  The general layout of the site, however, with some construction phases, can be suggested.  There is evidence of landscaping towards the Ebbsfleet, a plank revetment was found nearby,  and around the complex a number of intercutting ditches and one possible beamslot were found containing a large quantity of Roman building debris and pottery dating to the 1st - 2nd century AD.  A single late iron age/Roman cermation urn was found.  The excavation report does not record any further information on this burial so it is difficult assess whether this is supporting evidence of a pre-villa site or not. (11)The earliest stone-built villa on the site was constructed in the early 2nd century over an earlier Roman site (TQ 67 SW 297).  Associated with the villa were a substantial lime-kiln, either contemporay or pre-dating the villa,  two large aisled buildings, a bath-house (TQ 67 SW 1001), a substantial river-side wharf, arranged around a courtyard.  Occupation continued, at what level is unclear, into the 4th century. (12)In 2002 timbers from the wharf/quay were recovered along with parts of the nearby early medieval water mill (TQ 67 SW 298) to Chatham Historic Dockyard for recording, cleaning and preservation. Several of the timbers had been reused in the quay including wall studs.  This is similar to finds made in London. (13)"

The pottery, partly in the possession of the owner of the house and partly with Dr Ann Birchall, formerly of the B.M., indicates an extensive Belgic settlement preceded by a Marnian or closely related culture of C. 250 BC.  A few Marnian sherds bearing incised chevron decoration in haematite colouring are of particular importance as they are at present unique in this country (d).

The butt end of a ditch ( TR3126545887), one metre wide, orientated east to west was found containing fragments of early to mid iron age pottery. The shape of the ditch was of sloping sides with a flat base. Nearby was a possible gully with a sloping south-western edge and angled north-eastern edge.  No datable finds were recovered.  These features form part of a settlement which could include other nearby SMR records TR 34 NW 146/147 & 224) (1).Further evaluation work revealed a number of pit, ditch and postholes as negative features. Which extends the iron age settlement further to the south-east. These features found may be connected with the cropmark features of TR 34 NW 146 & 224, but this is unclear.  Flint tempered pottery found in one of the ditches suggests that the settlement may date to the early to mid iron age c.600-300 BC.(2)Additional excavtion work in 1995 uncovered evidence that the iron age features found previously belonged to two separate sites, one dating to the early - mid iron age (TR 34 NW 224) and the mid - late iron age.  The site consists of a rectangular enclosure bounded by a large ditch, with a two pits and three post-holes.  Heavy ploughing would have removed any evidence of associated internal buildings. A number of gullies were found outside the enclosure and may relate to associated features such as fields or animal compounds.  A large quantity of pottery was recovered, nearly two-thirds in the final re-cut of the enclosure ditch, dating to c.150 - 50 BC. It was mainly flint-tempered with a small quantity of grog-tempered ware of ""Belgic"" form. Within the south-west arm of the enclosure fragments of human cranium were found and a skull in the south-eatern arm. This skull, it is suggested, was ritually deposited and was recoverined in association with an animal leg bone, food offering, a flint nodule and a fragment of grog-tempered pottery.  A single inhumation burial was found outside the main enclosure, just to the south-east.  It was aligned ne-sw, parallel with the enclosure ditch.   The grave pit was quite small, ovoid, and although no dating evidence was found, it is believed to be of iron age date."
50008,Neolithic to Early Roman activity at Tutt Hill,HENGE,"Neolithic to Early Roman activity at Tutt Hill, with activity focused on the Neolithic and Late Bronze Age","The Oxford Archaeological Unit was commissioned by Union Railways (South) Ltd (URS) to conduct a field evaluation of land at Tutt Hill, Westwell, Kent.  The work was conducted in two stages: An open area excavation was carried out between 8th and 18th March 1999, following the discovery of significant archaeological remains during a watching brief on geotechnical test pits.  A second stage of evaluation was carried out in the surrounding area between 29th March and 9th April 1999.The watching brief and subsequent investigations revealed a diffuse scatter of prehistoric features, with one significant concentration of features and finds located in the main excavation area.  Twelve of the fourteen evaluation trenches contained no features at all, suggesting either that the group of pottery-rich pits in the main excavation area are the remanant of a more extensive but severely truncated site, or that they represent a verey localised area of occupation.The main excavation area was 40 m long and 20 m wide, with a 2m square extension on the south-western side.  The subsequent evaluation comprised fourteen trenches, each 30 m long and 1.8 m wide.  The only significant archaeological features comprised three pits of late Bronze Age and early Iron Age date, two of which produced substantial pottery groups, and three shallow ditches which are likely to be contemporary with the pits. (1)Subsequent general watching brief over a 1.1km stretch and a targeted watching brief of a 150m x 200m area revealed evidence of Neolithic to Early Roman activity. Two flint scatters show Neolithic - Early Bronze Age activity, with the Mid-Late Neolithic also represented by two pits. Four ring ditches representing ploughed-out round barrows with associated Beaker pottery date to the Late Neolithic-Early Bronze Age. These are heavily truncated, and no evidence of burials were found, though an Early-Middle Bronze Age cremation was located near the ring ditches. There was also a single Early Bronze Age pit.The Mid Bronze Age is represented by 3 sub-rectangular pits and a cremation pit contianing an inverted bucket urn.The Late Bronze Age sees the laying out of a field system, in addition to a few pits.Activity seems to decline after this, and the Mid Iron Age-Early Roman period is represented by only two pits, a cremation. A furnace-like structure at the west of the watching brief area may be Iron Age due to associate pottery finds, though these may be residual and the furnace may be much later in date.There are also a number of undated features, notable pits and a few cremations. Some medieval pottery. (2)Additional bibliogrpahy. (3-8)"
50009,"Late Iron Age/Romano-British settlement or villa site, Harrietsham",ENCLOSURE,"A Late Iron Age enclosed settlement associated with a road and cremation burials. The site continued in use during the Roman period. A small settlement or a possible villa existed in the immediate vicinity. In the late 3rd or early 4th century a group of nine aisled buildings were constructed, possibly barns serving the villa/settlement.","In 1985 Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit apparently carried out an excavation within the grounds of the Rectory. Pits and ditches of Roman date were supposedly found. It is also reported that walls of a building were found, possibly with a hypocaust. Work is also thought to have been carried out by Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit on land to the south on the medical centre and community hall site. (1)In April 1997 Canterbury Archaeological Trust carried out a watching brief began on work for new housing development at the site known as Glebeland at Harrietsham. Immediately archaeology was recovered and evaluation trenching commenced after consultation with the developer. Evidence gathered suggests that occupation of the site began in the Late Iron Age and continued into the Roman period until probably the 4thC. The site then seems to have been abandoned or contracted and a soil horizon accumulated over it. Cut into this soil horizon were the foundations of seven buildings.The settlement was found in the western side of the housing development site. A flint road bedded in chalk with side ditches (TQ 85 SE 137) aligned NE-SW led to and or through the site. To the south of the road a large N-S aligned ditch was discovered with a smaller ditch in front and a row of six post-holes probably formed a fence. This boundary ditch probably formed the beginning of the settlement. No structures were identified within the settlement area although a number of post-holes, other than the six mentioned above, were found, but with no apparent pattern. To the west of the boundary ditch a large feature was excavated which contained insufficient material to indicate that it was a rubbish or storage pit.Eleven, with a possible further six, cremation burials were found within the angle formed by the road and the boundary ditch, indicating that they were contemporary with each other. The concentration of burials in this area may be in part due to the depth of overburden being greater in this area, thus protecting it from plough damage. Of the eleven definite cremations, eight contained a single cremation, one contained two, one contained three ceramic urns and one contained three ceramic urns and a small bronze vessel. Only one of the burials had been cut by a later burial and another cut the road suggesting that it may have been in a state of disrepair at the time. (1)Geophysical survey to test for archaeological features just east of site found in 1997 during the CAT evaluation. Possible features located. (2).Predetermination evaluation on site showed that archaeological features indeed continued across this section of the field. It was not possible to identify what the features were or what age they were, other than the Late Iron Age/Romano-British road which was found where it was predicted to be and was in a good condition. (3)The Late Iron Age occupation of the site began in the latter part of the 1st century BC. A large boundary ditch crossed the site with an enclosure to the west. A flint-metalled road crossed the ditch to enter the enclosure. South of the road a group of nine Aylesford-type cremation burials were found. The vessels and a unique copper alloy vessel found within this group pre-date the Roman conquest. One of the burials cut the crushed chalk base of the road and indicates that this too must be pre-Roman in date. A further three burials were found east of the group and appear to be of late 2nd or early 3rd century date. During the late 1st or early 2nd century the road was realigned. The old road possibly became a yard surface at this time. No buildings were found within the enclosure of this date though domestic rubbish indicates it was probably located nearby. It is thought that this occupation relates to a small settlement or a villa complex. A build-up of silt over the site indicates a contraction or abandonment towards the end of the 2nd century or at the beginning of the 3rd century. Cut into this soil layer were foundations of nine substantial aisled buildings each c.13m wide and more than c.20m long. A coin was found in the foundations of one indicating a date of construction in the late 3rd or early 4th century. No domestic evidence was found within the buildings so they could be barns. (4)"

At the base of the barrow mound evidence of Mesolithic (TR 25 NE 82) and Later Neolithic  occupation was found, in the form of struck flints and pottery fragments. Early Medieval pottery was recovered from the outer mound. (1)A hearth found during excavation in 2004 beneath the central mound was subjected to archaeomagnetic dating. The last firing of the hearth is thought to have happened between 4060 and 3300 BC. There were problems with calibration for a feature of this early a date so it is uncertain how accurate the results are. A date in the Neolithic is, however, likely. (2)Further study of the barrow took place in the excavation of Trench 5 in 2004. It revealed plough damage and some of the detailed stratigraphy on the edge of the barrow. (5)This excavation also uncovered and confimed the presence of a ring ditch though thin artefactual evidence made dating difficult (5).The 2004 excavations unveiled an unusual feature, a cultivation terrace, predating the Anglo-saxon cemetery (See TR 25 NE 284) which was possibly Roman or earlier. (5)In 2005 another large portion of the prehistoric barrow were excavated. 120 cut-features were observed, including hollows pits post-holes and two sub-rectangular hearths. Evidence increasingly suggests that the barrow mound was erected within a pre-exissting ditched enclsure. Finds include large quantities of pottery, struck flint and calcined flint. These all relate to the late Neolithic. (3)In 2006 further excavation was carried out to examine the remains of the barrow and the surrounding area. In the remains of the barrow  further grooved water and beaker pottery was recovered. Bellow the barrow two dozen cut-features in the form of various pits and post-holes were observed, evidence for activity on the site prior to the barrow mound, possibly a ditched enclosure."

The barrow(s) may be part of a larger barrow cemetery exidence of which comes from cropmarks (TR 36 NE 407) and earlier investigations at the beginning of the 20th century.,"In 1992 an evaluation excavation excavated a multi-phased beaker period burial group. At approximately TR39286635 a dense patch of flints was observed.  On excavation beaker fragments and human bones were found in an open patch surrounded by the flints.  Work uncovered a total of seven crouched burials all of which either in direct contact with the beaker or superimposed interments. The overall feature was irregular in shape  cut into the chalk. Three bowl shaped pits are presumed to have been graves cut into the floor of the feature. At a later date further burials were added. All burials are aligned n-s or nw-se and are of adults and infants.  Some have been damaged by plough and are missing bones, not necessarily as a result of this later activity.  It is thought that the burials might represent either a,  burials within the ring ditch of a round barrow or b, burials within the boundaries of a settlement and cut into the floor of a hut, paralleled at Cottington Lane, Ebbsfleet 1990. (1)Topsoil stripping and excavation in 1994.  The feature is a ring ditch of oval shape from a round barrow.  Central within the ditch is a group of three inter-cutting pits which contained seven crouched burials.  Five of which are incomplete and appear to be missing their skulls.  In one pit beneath the rib cage of one burial was a near complete undecorated beaker food vessel.  The eastern segment of the barrow ditch had been cut by a pit containing two superimposed crouch burials and a final separate crouched burial was found metres from the barrow to the nw.  Evidence from locals tells of further single burials found during the construction of the Seven Stones Estate just to the south-east. Thirty metres to the south-west part of a curving length of ditch was recorded which may have formed a circle.  A small ditch on the inside area of the ditch contained fragments of beaker sherds.  It is possible that this also formed a round barrow.(2)See also (3)."

Champion in the 1970's (TR39396629) around ten acres in total. (1-3)See also (4)."
50013,"Prehistoric pits, near Cleve Court, Manston",MIDDEN,Two pits were found during an archaeological evaluation in 1994 prior to development at the Kent International Business Park. The two pits contained fragments of prehistoric flint-tempered pottery and the fill of one revealed hundreds of mussel shells. It is thought that the pit containing only 20 sherds of pottery may be the remains of a cremation burial pit that has been damaged by ploughing.,During an evaluation in 1994 two pit features were excavated.  Both contained fragments of flint-tempered prehistoric pottery and one hundreds of mussel shells.(10
50014,"Bronze Age-Early Iron Age occupation, Westwood Road, Broadstairs",DITCHED ENCLOSURE,"Round houses, pits, postholes and ditches dating from the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age were found during work ahead of the building of an ASDA supermarket.","In 1998 an evaluation was carried out by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology of the proposed site for a new ASDA supermarket. Two or more ditched enclosures were discovered, dating to the Bronze Age. An un-urned cremation burial was found in a ditch. (1)In 1999 the Trust for Thanet Archaeology and Canterbury Archaeological Trust carried out a strip, map and sample project on the site. Roundhouses, pits, postholes and ditches dating from the Bronze Age and Early Iron Age were found. The earliest feature was a Beaker period ditch. One feature dating from the Late Bronze Age to Early Iron Age contained an Acheulian handaxe. This was a small flint handaxe of cordate type dating to the Hoxnian Interglacial-Wolstonian Glaciation periods. It could either have been found during the Bronze Age and kept or deposited in the ditch during field clearing. (2)"
50015,"Late Iron Age/early Romano-British enclosure and field system, Brett's Gravel Pit, Charing",ENCLOSED SETTLEMENT,"A late Iron Age/early Romano-British farmstead, with central ditched enclosure and evidence of granary structures was found during archaeological investigations by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit (KARU) in advance of gravel extraction works. Associated with the settlement was a field system, a possible droveway and a cremation cemetery.","Excavation by the Kent Archaeological Rescue Unit (KARU) in advance of gravel extraction by Brett Gravel Ltd, extending their workings at Charing, revealed parts of two enclosures originating in the late pre-conquest iron age.  One, on the western side of the excavation site, forming part of a long single curving ditch and the other two ditches, to the east, forming the corner of either a square or rectangular enclosure.  Presumably these features related to one another, only 20 metres apart, forming part of a farmstead settlement.  Domestic rubbish, in the form of pottery, was recovered from the fill of these ditches.  The pottery (date range 10/25 AD to 75/100AD), was mostly of native grog-tempered ware but included sherds of Romanised sandy ware suggesting that the ditches could not have been completely filled in before the second half of the second century AD.  Three cremation burials were inserted in the corner of the rectangular or square enclosure in the later second century. (TQ 94 NW 31).  A late neolithic axehead was recovered from the fill of one of the ditches (TQ 94 NW 52). (1)Extension to the works in 1992 led to excavation again by KARU centred on TQ 935 491. A settlement site dating from 50 BC-AD 150 was discovered, features consisting of 14 post holes, 64 ditches, 55 gullies 30-100 pits and the remains of two 1st century cremation burials. The larger ditches form 2 groups, those running east-west seem to be part of a field-system with a possible central track, the north-south group seem to define possible tracks or droveways. These seem to lead from possible circular or oval enclosures to the south-east. The post-holes could represent 2 structures and a possible gateway. The pits are scattered unevenly along the length of the site. The two cremation burials were found at the south end of the site and have been substantially damaged by plough so much so that only the bottom halve remain.  They are ten metres apart and approximately 80m south-west of the mid 2nd century burials found in 1989 (TQ 94 NW 31). The site, in general has been  severely ploughed down over time.  Sherds from at least 40 vessels were found in the site dating to between 50 BC   150AD.  These were mainly native ware with a few samian wares.  Two brooches were found.  An late iron age brooch of iron form a ditch fill and a bronze Colchester BB style brooch from an un-stratified surface.(2)KARU again excavated still further to the north-west in 1995. They found 147 more features although some related to those already excavated in 1992 and 1989. More enclosures, ditches, gullies, pits, post-holes and possible field systems were found. The main feature found in 1995 appears to be a triangular ditched enclosure 40 m by 10-32m.  The enclosed area contained a large hearth at the east end with its own ditched compound.  In the west end of the site nearly 20 flint-packed post holes were found suggesting a 4-post structure and four 2-post structures possibly above ground granaries. Two parallel ditches to the north seem to create an outer enclosure.  Pottery from about 50 different vessels were found as domestic rubbish from the fill of the ditches.  Wares included decorated native wares, Gallo-Belgic imports and Romanised types dating to between 50BC to no later than 100AD.  No bone was found, presumably due to the acidic nature of the soil, but a bronze brooch dating to the end of the first century AD was recovered from a ditch as well.(3)The site has been cut by later medieval features (TQ 94 NW 55 & 56) and destroyed by sand extraction."
50016,"Two Bell Barrows, Springhead",BURNT MOUND,"Two overlapping mid Bronze Age bell barrows. The earliest had been partly eroded away and the central burial cut by a later Roman Road. The later barrow, only partly within the excavtion area was associated with a hearth, a possible boiling pit and a burnt mound.","During excavation work on the line of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link, close to Springhead, two overlapping ring-ditches representing barrows were found at the head of the Ebbsfleet Valley.  The earliest had a diameter of c.18m and lay within the excavation area.  Only half of the surrounding ditch survived, due to erosion, and the central, urned cremation burial had been truncated by a later Roman road. The other barrow, size unclear, extended beyond the excavation area to the south-west.  The size of the surrounding ditch was similar to the earlier barrow which it only just overlapped.  Within the later barrow ditch a large quantity of burnt flint and charcoal was recovered.  The source of these finds were a large sub-circular hearth, a boiling pit and an associated burnt mound which had slumped into the fill of the barrow ditch.(1)"
50017,"Later Bronze Age Cemetery, Shrubsoles Hill, Sheppey",FUNERAL PYRE,"Later Bronze Age cremation cemetery containing between six and eleven burials, associated with a larger enclosure (TQ 97 SE 44).","A total of 37 deposits were found containing cremated human bone, although only 11 are thought to actually represent cremation burials with the rest representing incomplete burials or pyre-related deposits.  Generally all the features related to the burials are circular in shape, 0.25m - 0.30m in diameter, containing burnt flint, charcoal and bone, none of which were urned.  The features considered to be actual burials seem to form small groupings close to the line of a ditch which formed part of a larger enclosure (TQ 97 SE 44).  The associated features containing ""token"" deposits were spread around the edges of the enclosure. Two features found possibly represent pyre sites, but the evidence is uncertain.  Pottery fragments recovered date to the Late Bronze Age c.1400 - 700 BC.  The human bone recovered was found to be in a highly fragmentary state making identification of skeletal elements difficult.  Analysis of the bone fragments suggests that there are 11 ""true"" cremation burials, of adults and juveniles, the other deposits being cremation related.  Two possible pyre sites were identified.

50018,"An Iron Age site at Hartsdown Technology College, Margate",ENCLOSURE,"A series of archaeological investigations during the redevelopment of Hartsdown Technology College, revealed evidence of two Iron Age field enclosures, probably related to pastoral activities. A crouched inhumation burial in a pit, cut into one of the enclosures, was also recorded along with a second pit that contained evidence of possible ritual deposition. Pottery analysis of sherds from certain key features suggested they could be assigned to the early Iron Age, perhaps the 5th to 4th centuries BC.","In january 2001, an archaeological evaluation took place on land at Hartsdown Technology College, in advance of proposals to redevelop the site. Three areas were examined and five trenches cut. These were, an area of proposed new car parking bays (centred on 634418,169902), the area of the proposed new science block (centred on 634505,169870) and the area of the proposed new sports facilities (centred on 634575,169885). Late prehistoric features were recorded in the areas of the science block and sports facilities trenching. No archaeological features were observed in the area of the proposed new car parking bays. In the science block trenches, a single gully was recorded running through both trenches and a large enclosure ditch, 2m + wide, containing struck flint, late prehistoric pottery and animal bone in its fill. In the sports facilities trenches, a second large enclosure ditch was recorded in both trenches, 1.85m wide, again it contained struck flint, prehistoric pottery and animal bone. A crouched inhumation burial was recorded and left in situ, in the top of this ditch. The evaluation report considered it likely that the burial was of iron age date (although it could be earlier-see comment on the burial by Jonathan Last). The enclosure ditches were considered to be of late prehistoric date and probably associated with the extensive cropmarks of assumed bronze age/iron age date that are known to be present south and east of the college (see the cropmark GIS layer) [01].In february 2001, an archaeological excavation took place on the area of the proposed new sports facilities, that had been trial trenched during the evaluation stage (see above). The excavation re-investigated the enclosure ditch, which turned out to be two enclosure ditches (one a recut of the other) and the crouched inhumation burial within the ditch (both identified during the evaluation). The earlier enclosure ditch ran across the full width of the site for 25m, it had a V-shaped profile and was between 1.5 and 2m wide and up to 0.77m deep. As with the evaluation the principal fill of the ditch contained early Iron Age pottery, animal bone, struck flint and burnt flint. An upperfill identified in the middle section of the ditch only, contained pottery, animal bone, struck flint and burnt flint. The recut at the south western end of the ditch had a very different profile, steep sided and with a flatish base. The NNE terminus of the recut was recorded within the excavated area. The recut contained two fills and displayed some evidence of chalk slumping as in the main ditch. The lower fill contained iron age pottery, animal bone and struck flint. The inhumation was fully excavated; the burial was contained within a steep sided, flat bottomed, sub rectangular grave pit, which had truncated the upper fill of the main enclosure ditch. The body had been placed in a crouched position, head to south, feet to north, lying on its right side facing east. The grave contained no grave goods, but the grave fill did contain struck flints and animal bone and the inhumation has been interpreted as falling into the same date range as the other features. Within the area bounded by the enclosure ditch and its recut, a single, sub-circular pit was recorded. Steep sided and with a flat base, it contained four fills. The layer above the basal fill contained considerable quantities of early iron age pottery and daub, animal bone, struck and burnt flint, three copper-alloy objects and charcoal. The layer above this contained pottery, while the upper fill contained pottery, animal bone, struck and burnt flint.In the north western corner of the site, a narrow curvilinear gully was observed. Its southern terminus was recorded within the excavation area, although it extended out of the site to the north west. The gully had a V-shaped profile, steep sloping sides and a narrow, flat base. The gully had two fills, the lower of which contained pottery, animal bone, struck flint, burnt flint and burnt bone.Finally, a n-s ditch terminal was observed, for a ditch 1.4m wide, running out of the excavation area to the north. Irregular in profile, no finds were present in its single fill.The report concludes that all the features and the crouched inhumation are dated on the basis of the ceramic evidence (from certain key features), to the 5th or 4th centuries BC. The site has at least two phases, with the original enclosure ditch silting up to be partially replaced by the recut, on a similar alignment and the inhumation burial cut into the original ditch. The college would seem to be surrounded by substantial prehistoric activity [02].The results of the earlier evaluation lead to a watching brief being carried out during the groundworks associated with the construction of the Science Block. A number of archaeological features were observed, some of which had previously been recorded during the evaluation work. The gully previously recorded ran across the entire area of the footprint of the proposed new building, aligned NW-SE, although the gully was not further excavated. Likewise the large enclosure ditch (3m wide by 1m deep), aligned N-S, recorded during the evaluation, which was examined further duing the watching brief. Slightly curvilinear in plan, it may have terminated to the north, although this could not be confirmed due to modern intrusions (NB it did not appear in the first evaluation trench). The ditch contained the highest quantity of animal bone on site. It was truncated by a new shallow curvilinear ditch (only seen in this watching brief), roughly N/S aligned, curving to the SW towards its southern terminal end, that had been caught within the watching brief area. The ditch, interpreted as a third enclosure ditch, was 1.5m wide by 0.25m deep, with sloping sides and a flat base and it continued north into the area of modern disturbance. Early iron age pottery, animal bone, struck flint and lava quern fragments were recovered from the ditch. The quern fragments have been interpreted as possibly being intrusive or suggesting a later Iron Age date for this feature. The intercutting curvilinears suggest at least two phases of activity in this area of site. The enclosure ditches in the science block area are on a markedly different alignment to the enclosure ditches recorded under the New Sports Hall.  [03].Archaeological assessment and updated project design for the publication of the excavation works at the College, with a Finds Assessment. See comments on the burial (p.8, 17-18) [04].The final excavation report: covering the initial evaluation, main excavation and science block watching brief. Although it repeats previously stated information, discussions and conclusions in the main, there are a number of new points made. One is that the early iron age pottery found in the shallow curvilinear cutting the main enclosure ditch recorded under the Science Block, maybe residual material from the cutting of the enclosure ditch. The report makes further reference to the nearby cropmarks and how they may relate to the features recorded. It states that the gully running under the science block may cut the earlier enclosure ditch recorded there. It also associates the pit found under the new sports hall with possible ritual activity. It concludes that the evidence suggests that the site consisted of small single period prehistoric enclosures, associated surrounding enclosures and field sytems seen on the aerial photographs.See comments on the crouched inhumation (p.13-14).There is also a section in the report on specialist reports. [05].This watching brief for a single storey inclusion building, south of the new science block where the above archaeological works took place, observed no archaeological finds or features. It is possible that features survived unaffected, below the depth of the new development. Archaeological features were recorded in the above works below the subsoil. [06].This watching brief on an extension to the netball courts at the college, observed no archaeological features or finds. The site was not stripped to the depth at which archaeological features were observed to the north west, although the report does state that the site was reduced to the level of the natural [07]."
50019,"Iron Age/early Roman occupation at Waterbrook Farm, Sevington",SETTLEMENT,Iron Age/early Roman occupation found at Waterbrook Farm in 1993 during an excavation.,"An evaluation in 1992 and a subsequent excavation in 1993, both carried out by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, at Waterbrook Farm found a possible Iron Age or early Roman enclosure. It was paritally excavated on the northern edge of the site. The part exposed consists of two ditches which form a right angle. There are two entrances at the north-east and south-west corners. A concentration of pits within the enclosed area may relate to a period of occupation. A ditch is present, its function may have been for drainage, suggesting problems with flooding during the occupation on the site. Similar drainage ditches can be found on the opposite side of the river. The settlement is mid to late 1st century with pre-Flavian pottery. (1)An evaluation in 1992 and a subsequent excavation in 1993, both carried out by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, at Waterbrook Farm found a settlement clustered around the banks of a palaeochannel. Flooding of the settlement may have been a problem, several drainage ditches were present and canalising of the river before it was eventually infilled. The main period of occupation looks to be the late Iron Age, probably about 50 years before the Roman invasion, a date dedcued from recovered ceramics. Several rubbish pits were present on this site as well as one cremation.The archaeological features represented a short lived, though it was a continuously occupied native settlement. Ceramic evidence suggests that the site was enclosed in the late Iron Age and continued in use for c.150 yrs into the Roman period with occupation mostly situated on a low rise in the flood plain. The site lay adjacent to a relict channel of the East Stour, which probably once formed an oxbow encircling the settlement on 3 sides. The abrupt termination of the occupation in the 2nd century AD may have been due to the wetness of the site. (2)An evaluation in 1992 and a subsequent excavation in 1993, both carried out by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, at Waterbrook Farm found several cremations were found during the excavation. Three cremations were excavated, all crushed but with substantially complete pottery vessels dating to before AD 70 and were discovered in the base of two ditches. They appear to be simple cremation burial with the ditch, which is not uncommon. There is no burnt bone associated with but it may have degraded. Two more possible cremation burials in a similar state were found again in the base of a ditch. A heavily truncated cremation burial was situated in the south-eastern corner of an enclosure, though the two features may not be contemorary. The orginal cut for the burial was filled with a charcoal deposit, suggesting the pyre for the burning was situated nearby. The cut contained a number of fragments of burnt bone and sherds of a pottery vessel, which was a 1st to 2nd century 'Upchurch ware' bowl. A cinerary vessle may have been present but no longer exists and therefore of one were present it was biodegradable. This creamation was undated. There was one other possible cremation which was isolated and heavily truncated at the eastern edge of the site. It contained charcoal ash and burnt bone, which might have been an un-closed  cremation burial. Un-closed cremation burials are quite common in rural cemetries of Romano-British date, following a tradition of Iron Age cremations without containers. (1)A further archaeological excavation was carried out in 2007 aiming to create a better understanding of the earlier work carried out. A number of Iron Age and Roman features were excated increasing the knowledge of the site. The Late Iron Age to Romano British era consists mostly of enclosures and ditches associeated with ring gullies interpreted as drip gullies for roundhouses. The pottery assemblage spans most of the period, at least five phases of roundhouse construction were identified with later enclosure ditches suggesting a long time survival within the landscape. A total of four undated creamation deposits containing human bone were excavated. These are potenttially of this period. There was also limited Tomano-British Activity, comprising of ditches and pits, however the assemblages suggest that they had a relationship with the earlier activity on the site. (3)"
50021,"Iron Age and Roman occupation, Leysdown Road, Warden Bay",RECTILINEAR ENCLOSURE,"Intensive activity from the Middle Iron Age through the Roman period consisting of rubbish pits, trackways, an enclosure and fields, plus burials.","Between 2009 and 2011 Archaeology South-East carried out a programme of works on land north of Leysdown Road, Warden Bay, on the site now occupied by Warden Bay Primary School and land to the east of it. From the Middle Iron Age the site was the focus for a variety of activity types. The earliest phase of this occupation consisted of numerous shallow pits and/post holes. A number of larger pits, gullies and a hearth were also found. One gully may have related to a roundhouse. Two lengths of ditch were also found and are thought to perhaps represent the corner of a field. The site later developed with the laying out of a rectilinear enclosure and a stock funnel that fed into the enclosure. This fell out of use and was replaced by an east-west droveway. This route had regular gaps along its length, suggesting entrances to fields. Another trackway was established at this time going north-south across the site. The third phase of activity in the Late Iron Age/early Roman period saw another north-south route laid out across the site, on a slightly different alignment to the earlier one. This phase of activity also featured two burials. The first was a cremation in a pit accompanied by two fragmented vessels and two copper objects (initially described as 6 brooches and a copper alloy pestle and motar (1)). The vessels may have been deliberately broken prior to deposition. The pit was associated with a later post hole that may have served as a marker for the burial. An inhumation of an adult female was also found belonging to this period; the only accompanying grave good with this burial was a copper alloy finger ring worn on the right hand.The Roman period proper featured a re-cutting of the southern part of the north-south routeway and the addition of a northwest-southeast route. A small number of pits were dug and some were used for the disposal of cess as well as domestic refuse. Only two post holes were assigned to this period and it appears that no trace of structures has survived. Two plough truncated Roman vessels were found within the subsoil and possibly represent a disturbed cremation, though no trace of cremated remains was found. (2)"
50022,"Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age settlement, Shelford Farm Estate",ENCLOSED SETTLEMENT,"A possibly enclosed settlement site with evidence of buildings, associated pits, hearths and industrial/agricultural features. There were also cremation burials and possible ritual deposits.","In 2002 Canterbury Archaeology Trust carried out an excavation ahead of clay extraction at Shelford Farm Estate. A possibly enclosed  settlement of Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age date was found. Domestic features included post-built structures, hearths and storage or refuse pits. Of particular interest were three pits which each contained in situ partially complete vessels, perhaps used as small ovens, basins or food preparation/storage containers. The structures consisted of three square four-post structures and at least six subrectangular and near circular or oval post- and stake-hole structures. The largest of these was evidenced by at least 26 post holes though there are two possible reconstructions of its original form (circular with a porch or rectangular). Industrial or agricultural features included a possible corn-drying oven and a possible furnace. A group of seven cremation burials and other probably ritual deposits were found away from the main centre of activity on the site. One such pit produced several large fragments of pottery, quernstone fragments, hammerstones and considerable quantities of chared cereal grains. (1)"

A north-south ditch crossed the site, 110m of its length being exposed. It is thought to have been a field ditch though no entrances to fields could be found along its length. The fill contained residual worked flints but also worked flints of the Middle to Late Bronze Age. The worked flints included a horned scraper, a concave scraper, a side scraper and two hammerstones. Five cremations were found near the ditch. All but one were unurned. The urned cremation had been deposited in a Late Bronze Age/Early Iron Age vessel. (1)"

Later Bronze Age enclosure ditches and unaccompanied cremations, early Iron Age storage pits and 4 post structures appeared in clusters which included placed deposits.<gg_summary>: Late Iron Age enclosure ditches and pits. Several of these have interesting deposits - single potin coins at the base of three features, a complete pot, a Langton Down brooch, etc. (Allen et al. 2012, 176-8).","During A2 widening works in 2007 a number of late Bronze Age enclosures and unaccompanied cremations were discovered. These were followed by Iron Age four post structures in clusters and included  placed deposits. The placed deposits included whole pots, iron objects, charred grain and loom weights. Three particularly rich pits contained salt containers, tray fragments and pedestals which may have suggested salt manufacture?Activity on-site appears to have nucleated in the middle Iron Age when a series of enclosure ditches were dug (these were later extended). Ritual deposition occurred throughout the Iron Age. One inhumation burial came from a pit and several cremations were found, one accompanied by two pots and four brooches, two connected by a chain, the other buried in a bronze bound decorated yew bucket accompanied by four pots and a bronze sheath, probably from a drinking horn. The site was abandoned during the Roman period as later field boundaries were cut through the site (some Roman finds occurred). The area was re-used during the medieval period which produced evidence of sunken featured buildings, subrectangular pits, kilns and deneholes (1)."
50026,"Six early Bronze Age round barrows, Cliffs End Farm",POST BUILT STRUCTURE,"During excavation in advance of new housing, 6 early bronze age barrows were discovered. The excavators suggested that barrow 1, the south-westernmost, was the initial barrow around which the others had been grouped. Each barrow survived in the form of its ditches and in four cases, an internal features, probably a grave. No traces of any mounds survived, nor could they be inferred.","In 2004/5 the site at Cliffs End Farm was excavated. The earliest evidenced activity on the site consisted of six Early Bronze Age round barrows. Soil conditions on the site meant that bone had not survived and as such no burials were located. Despite this, the central burial of the first barrow (double-ditched, barrow 1) was located, the grave containing a collection of flint tools and a bronze object (too corroded for identification). Part of this barrow remains in situ below a tree on the site. The second barrow, to the north of the first, had a structure at its centre made up from four post holes in a rectangular arrangement. A similar structure was found at the centre of the third barrow. The fourth barrow had three ring ditches around it and again had a structure at its centre. (1)The barrows were accompanied by a substantial quantity of struck flint and pottery, all of which suggested an early bronze age date. Two of the barrows (barrow 1 and 2) also contained pottery believed to derive from Beaker vessels. (2) (3)"

50029,"Late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age funerary, domestic, and agricultural landscapes, Saltwood",FIELD SYSTEM,"Late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age funerary, domestic, and agricultural landscapes, Saltwood","Excavations carried out between 1998-2001 at the Saltwood Tunnel and Stone Farm Bridleway sites, by Canterbury Archaeology Trust and Wessex Archaeology, as part of the CTRL works.Late Bronze Age / Early Iron Age funary, domestic, and agricultural landscapes.An area around the eastern-most Early Bronze Age barrow (TR 13 NE 214) (one of the two larger barrows) appears to have been utilised as a funerary environment. A small sub-square enclosure lies to the east of the barrow, orientated with the adjacent field system, and is associated with features containing cremated bone. A cremation lies within, but is stratigraphically earlier than, the enclosure and is not central within the enclosure. A single cremation lies 250m to the SW (not associated with a barrow), with a further 5 confirmed and 2 possible cremations within and around the large barrow to the west. These later 7 cremations are spatially dated, but could date to the Late Iron Age / Early Roman period due their location next to a trackway (TR 13 NE 220) of that date.Settlement is focused around one or two partially identified sub-rectangular enclosures in the centre of the excavated area. The enclosures appear to be delimited by both ditches and a small section of a post line, though the relative dating is unknown. A large number of post-holes to the west of one of the enclosures may represent a series of fence-lines or small structures, though the form of any is unclear. They could represent the western side of an enclosure, the exact line of which varied over time. Additional ditches suggest a field system, which respects the position of the earlier barrows. A number of pits with cinder-capping were noted (the cinder-capping acting as an odour plug on refuge pits). Additional pits and post-holes suggest a settlement focus. It is possible that the trackways (TR 13 NE 220) that are more prominent in later phases have their origins in this phase. (1)Additional bibliography. (2-3)"
50030,"Iron Age site, St. Stephen's College site, North Foreland",ENCLOSURE,An Early Iron Age to Middle Iron Age enclosure with possible occupation into the Late Iron Age.,"In 1999 the Trust for Thanet Archaeology carried out an evaluation of the St. Stephen's College site. Several pits were found containing Early Iron Age and Late Iron Age pottery. A possible palisade trench was also found but did not contain any datable material. The Early Iron Age pottery was largely described as residual with most of the features dated by the Late Iron Age sherds, i.e. 150-50 BC. Despite this, it is likely that there was Early Iron Age occupation in the area dating to c.550-350 BC. (1)A joint excavation by Canterbury Archaeological Trust and the Trust for Thanet Archaeology following an evaluation and an initial strip and map phase. The final phase of excavation work was carried out by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology alone. All the work was carried out in 1999.From the Early Iron Age there was an enclosure on the site. Several possible four post structures were located within the enclosure. A number of pits were also dug during this occupation. Activity continued through the Middle Iron Age and possibly into the Late Iron Age. Material from the Late Iron Age was found in the upper fills of many older features, though some pits were located in the same area as the Early and Middle Iron Age pits, suggesting some possible continuation of occupation on the site. (2)In 2003 the land to the south was excavated by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology. The southern half of the enclosure ditch was located along with a scatter of features to the south, east and west of this. The ditch itself appears to have been dug in the Middle Iron Age. Disarticulated human bones were found within it, along with disturbed earlier material suggesting site clearance in the Late Iron Age. Other features of Early to Middle Iron Age date included large storage pits, some of which contained human remains. An adult female had been buried in one and the disarticulated remains of a neonate were found in a second. A further crouched inhumation of an adult female was found with Early to Middle Iron Age pottery. A number of pit or post alignments were found, one of which had disturbed the burial.The Late Iron Age saw further pit or post hole alignments created. Two ditches were dug at this time, one shorter and the other a boundary ditch dug across the site (it was also encountered on the site to the north). Disarticulated human bones (male and female, adult, young adult and neonate) were found in both features. A pit group dated to this period also contained disarticulated human ribs. Only three early Roman features were found, suggesting the site had gone out of use in the Late Iron Age. (3)"
50031,"Iron Age boundary ditch, Downs Road",DITCH,"A large ditch, probably with a bank to the west of it. The partially filled ditch was the focus for a number of later inhumations.","In 2006 Oxford Archaeology carried out work at the site. A large boundary ditch which probably had a bank to the west of it. The earliest silting of the ditch contained Middle Iron Age pottery. Subsequently the ditch was partially filled, possibly with material from the slighting of the bank. Two inhumation burials were dug into this material. These were of an adult and an infant. An additional inhumation was placed in the southern terminal of the ditch, in a coffin, and was associated with a mid 1st century vessel. The ditch finally silted in the Roman period. A crouched inhumation of a 11-13 year old child was found nearby but was undated. A number of Middle Iron Age gullies and pits were also recorded in the area. One pit contained a cow skull and what are likely to be instances of structured deposition. The bank may have survived as a feature for some considerable time as later features appear to respect the likely area it would have occupied. (1)"
50032,"Late Iron Age enclosed settlement, Northumberland Bottom",ENCLOSURE,"An enclosed settlement was established in the Late Iron Age between Downs Road and Wrotham Road dry valleys on the west-facing hillside. The site continued in use into the Roman period, reaching its height in the late 1st century AD.","In 1998 Museum of London Archaeology Service carried out an excavation as part of the Channel Tunnel Rail Link project. An enclosed settlement was established between Downs Road and Wrotham Road dry valleys on the west-facing hillside. The site continued in use into the Roman period, reaching its height in the late 1st century AD.The earliest phase of activity related to a hollow way with a ditch and bank that could have been of Middle Iron Age date. In the Late Iron Age, an enclosure was laid out to the east of the hollow way. The earliest use of this may have been livestock related as there were no traces of domestic activity. The enclosure was subsequently enlarged, putting the hollow way out of use. Within this larger enclosure, there were a number of pits, ovens or kilns a possible hearth and two burials. One was cremation in a pedestal urn in a small pit on the east side of the enclosure. A copper alloy open ring was found within it. Disarticulated human remains of at least two individuals were found in a pit near the entrance on the north side of the enclosure. The pit also contained two fragments of loomweights and a Colchester type one-piece bow brooch. The pit was filled by the end of the 1st century AD. A horse burial was found on the west side of the enclosure. The animal had been 11-15.5 years old, 1.4-149m high (14-14 1/2 hands) with signs of traction and riding stresses. (1-3)"

Three ditches crossing the site were dated to the Late Iron Age/early Roman period. The site was subsequently used for cremation burials. Four such burials were found in the south east corner of the site, three had accompanying vessels and one was a single urned cremation. (1)"
50034,"Early Bronze Age activity, Springhead",FIELD SYSTEM,Early Bronze Age activity was found across part of the site in the form of Beaker and Collared Urn fragments but also two small clusters of pits and a variety of other features.,"In 2007/8 Wessex Archaeology carried out a programme of works. An area of the site contained a number of Early Bronze Age features, with material of this date also recovered from later features in the same area. Two small clusters of Beaker pits were found. Material from these pits included grain and weed seeds, a large number of worked flints, including 34 scrapers from one pit and sherds of pottery. Flintworking debris had been dumped in the pits, one pit contained an arrowhead roughout. Flints were refitted from different pits, suggesting that the pits had been open at the same time and received dumps of material from the same source. One of the pits had flints placed against the edges of the pit, presumably deliberately. Another possibly deliberately placed deposit was found at the base of a pit, consisting of a set of tools - four end-scrapers, two backed knives, a broken blade and a hammerstone, with sherds of pottery. This was all associated with a large quantity of hazelnuts. Other features included three post holes in a triangular arrangement and clay-lined pits. Parts of a field system (TQ 67 SW 1356) may have been established in this period. A number of the ditches had Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age objects in basal fills or in termini. An un-urned cremation burial was also found, it was dated to this period on the basis of proximity to other features. (1)"
50035,"Bronze Age field system, Springhead",FIELD SYSTEM,"A Middle and Late Bronze Age field system, plus pits (some of which contained possible ritual deposits) and un-urned cremations.","In 2007/8 Wessex Archaeology carried out a programme of works. A Bronze Age field system was laid out across the area. Elements of the system may have been created in the Early Bronze Age (see TQ 67 SW 1355) but the full system was of Middle and Late Bronze Age date. A droveway was associated with the system and continued in use possibly into the Roman period. Post holes of a possible fenceline were sealed below Bronze Age colluvium. The fence was on the same alignment as the field system. There were no traces of structures found but a number of pits were scattered across the site, perhaps indicating some form of domestic occupation of the area. Many of these were clay lined, as the Early Bronze Age pits had been. One pit contained an inverted Deverel-Rimbury vessel, along with two scrapers and a blade. Another pit had two vessels, one within another. No cremated remains were found with these and one pit may have originally had a domed structure sealing it. These may therefore have been placed deposits of some ritual function. These were not the only form of structured deposition found on the site; the terminal of one of the field ditches contained a concentration of finds that may have been a placed deposit. Numerous Late Bronze Age-Early Iron Age sherds, particularly deliberately broken rim sherds, were found. A partially articulated buzzard was also found in this deposit. A number of un-urned cremations and features with cremation related deposits within them were found across the site. These are prehistoric in date and perhaps of this particular phase of activity. (1)An evaluation by Wessex Archaeology in 2008 to the north of the area excavated in 2007/8 found the ditches of the field system. (2)In 2012 Wessex Archaeology carried out a strip, map and sample excavation on the North Kent Community Church site to the north of the 2007/8 work. Ditches of the field system were found to continue across the site. (3)"
50036,"Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age cremation cemetery, Highstead Farm",FUNERAL PYRE,"A platform, possibly a pyre site, and a scatter of grouped and isolated pits, possibly representing urned cremations and pyre deposits.","In 2001 Archaeology South-East carried out an excavation. An extensive Middle Bronze Age to Late Bronze Age cremation cemetery was found. A sub-circular platform was located on the eastern part of the site. It was c.10m x8m and was formed by the cutting of a complex series of curving ditches. Burnt material was found in the ditches along with large quantities of Late Bronze Age pottery and a small quantity of Middle Bronze Age pottery.  There was a rectangular pit located in the centre of the platform, again containing burnt material and Middle Bronze Age pottery. Seven post holes were found around the area. Gullies to the north possibly represented an entranceway. The platform may have been a pyre site and/or a ploughed out barrow. Two possible pyre deposits, one potentially an urned cremation, were found nearby.Across the central part of the site, at least 43 possible cremations/pyre deposits were found. Several contained pottery sherds and these could have derived from burial containers. The deposits were found in both isolated positions and in discrete groups. A number of possible pyre sites were found, some associated with clusters of burials. A Middle Bronze Age/Late Bronze Age ditch possibly enclosed part of the site. (1)"

A small Middle Bronze Age cremation cemetery was found in the northern part of the site. Six unurned cremations were found in a group (with one outlier). No finds or pottery were associated with any of the cremations. Also dating to this period was a small pit containing a near complete possibly miniature plain globular pot. This deposit was thought to possibly relate to the cremation cemetery given the presence of burnt material. Radiocarbon dating for the cremations and the vessel deposit were all in the Middle Bronze Age. (1)"

Pits, a well, a cremation and metalworking evidence all suggest the presence of a settlement in the vicinity.","During the East Kent Access Route excavations a number of bronze age to early iron age features were discovered (phases 2 - 4). These suggested a pattern of field boundaries and enclosures that changed alignment in the later bronze age from east-west to north-east south-west. Pits, enclosures, metalled surfaces, a well, a cremation in a collared urn and metalworking evidence all suggest the presence of a settlement in the vicinity.  A shield binding was also found from a late iron age context.Phase 3c in particular contained remains of a early to middle iron age settlement. A series of domestic enclosures and droveways were created. There were several groups of pits and postholes containing domestic waste, loomweights and quernstones. There were at least 5 discrete enclosures, each containing domestic remains such as pits, postholes, fences, round-houses and  four-post structures which were probably grain stores .As with zones 4 and 7 of the East Kent Access excavations evidence was found of the enclosure of the neck of the peninsula by an iron age ditch that was later recut during the Roman period (dated by pottery finds) , possibly with a military function (based on the 'V'shape of the Roman recut). Other finds were recovered from the early Roman period including a post-Claudian Nauheim brooch and a Colchester fibula. Once the Roman ditch was cut there was a general decline in the intensity of the use of this area with no further round houses. By the middle Roman period the pattern of enclosures and ditches had almost completely disappeared. Two sunken-features buildings were instead constructed, one close to a small cemetery on the western limit of the excavation. The building itself went out of use and an oven was constructed in the hollow. (1)"
50040,Late Iron Age-Roman Activity at Thanet Earth,SQUARE ENCLOSURE,"Late Iron Age -Roman features, including ditches and cremation burials were observed in an evaluation in 2007 and 2008.","An archaeological evaluation took place in 2007 and 2008 on the site which is now Thanet Earth. Generally, finds of this period were sparse compared with some of the other periods. There did not seem to be any concentration of activity sucah as a settlement. At least three separate hollow ways, extending across the site from east to west, one curving to the north_east, were in use during the Roman period, but almost certainly originated as routes before, probably in the Iron Age. Small groups of cremation burials were associated with one of these trackways, as was a single Roman structure. Two phases of rectilinear field system defined by ditches were also located, the earlier probably originating in the late Iron Age. Two small square enclosures were located that wereassociated with the earlier field system. Enclosure 10 contained three cremation burials (G8162, two of which were quite richly furnished box burials) suggesting that it was a mortuary enclosure. At least some of the burials may be related to the only definite Roman structure located on the site (SFB 1) which consisted of an isolated sunken_featured structure, similar in some ways to others previously found on Thanet, but otherwise unique. Other remains included a number of quarries and isolated pits mostly situated in the northern half of the Thanet Earth site; this concentration of remains, steadily diminishing towards the southern higher areas, is a facet of the feature distribution as a whole.

Many of the barrows have been excavated, including three which contained cart burials.","Arras Iron Age Barrow Cemetery, _ m. south-west of Arras and bisected by the A1079. Originally there were over a hundred small round barrows, 8-30ft in diameter, and 1-3ft high, in this cemetery, although the majority have since been levelled by cultivation. The majority of barrows covered simple inhumations accompanied by bronze brooches, armlets and beads. Three of the burials were probably those of chieftains (one a women), as they were more richly furnished and contained the dismantled remains of chariots and horse harness and in one case the skeletons of the two ponies which had pulled the vehicle. <1> A large Iron Age cemetery lying in the vicinity of Arras and Hessleskew farms comprised at least 100 or 200 small barrows, many of which were opened in 1815-17 by E.W.Stillingfleet and B.Clarkson. Dr.Hull of Beverley also appears to have been involved at about this time. Three more were opened by the Yorkshire Antiquarian Club in 1850. Most barrows were found to contain a contracted skeleton, some with ornaments, Greenwell refers to their proximity to Bronze Age barrows. For particular discoveries of.PRNs 5923-5932.

The majority of these barrows were excavated between 1815 and 1817 by the Rev E.W Stillingfleet and a chariot-burial was discovered in a chalk-pit here in 1876. Continuous cultivation has so levelled the site that today only three barrows cab be detected under ideal conditions. In 1959 a proton magnetometer survey, followed by selective excavation was undertaken. Two square enclosures, each defined by a ditch and each originally having had a barrow in the centre were uncovered. The first was some 40'-42' square, with a ditch 6' 8"" wide and 3'-3' 6"" deep. A small sherd, possibly of Iron Age date, was found in the ditch silting. At the centre of the enclosure; a now very slight mound covered a disturbed grave, orientated north to south, containing skull fragments and an iron penannular brooch. To the south, the second enclosure ('B' at SE 9310 4116) was some 34'-36' square, with a ditch 6'-7' wide and 3'-4' deep. Excavation showed that any interment must have been on or above the old ground surface and long since removed. A third square enclosure (at 'C' SE 9281 4770) was excavated by the Yorkshire Antiquarian Club in May 1850. All barrows in this group have been totally ploughed out. Published survey (25"") revised. Listed by Challis and Harding under 'La Tene Burials'. <4> The 'King's Barrow', excavated by E.W.

It contained a skeleton on its back, and, near the skull, the skulls of two pigs. On either side of the inhumation lay a horse on top of which rested a wheel. In the western half ot he grave were two linch-pins, two harness loops, five terrets and two horse-bits. <5> SE 94 SW 04 The 'Queen's Barrow', opened by E.W.

It had formerly been noted by Mortimer (1) who mentions the ""filled up inner ditch of a supposed camp"" in describing a burial discovered in a chalkpit within the 'camp' in 1868. The burial was associated with an iron sword, shield, spearhead etc. (Finds in the BM) Three other inhumations were unaccompanied. A trial excavation was carried out in 1958 followed by further excavations in 1961/2.The defences consisted of a single ditch 6-7 feet deep, 10-15 feet wide, with a berm on the inside 12 to 15 feet wide, behind that a timber laced bank 6 feet wide, and an entrance in the SE; enclosing approx 8 acres. (See plan). Eight four-post structures within the enclosure were interpreted as granaries. A large quantity of pottery and animal bones came mainly from the ditch. Medieval and RB pottery and a sherd of a BA collared urn, came from the surface of the interior. An unaccompanied crouched burial was found in the filling of the ditch. Stead suggests a date of 1st century BC for the warrior burial found in 1868, the decoration on the shield being La Tene Style. However, he points out that the burial, granaries and hill fort need not be contemporary. (1-4)Site is still under plough, and no intelligible remains of the work survive. In both excavation areas (see plan) the rampart is just discernible as a broad swelling, but elsewhere its course can only be envisaged from the general contour of the ground.

Excavations also identified an Anglo-Saxon Grubenhaus along with spindle whorls, a bone comb and 5th century pottery sherds.","SE 816 454. Roman auxiliary fort of 3_ acres discovered by J.K St Joseph (A.P's BQQ 9 and 10) at SE 816 454, Hayton parish. The aerial photographs taken by St. Joseph in 1974 show a small fort surrounded by double ditches, distinct on the south-east, north-east and north-west sides, with rounded angles. Further photography in 1975 introduced the possibility that the fort had a single-ditched annexe to the north-east. A small scale excavation in Febuary 1975 located the eastern angle, parts of the angle-tower and the south-east gateway. In October and November 1975 further excavations took place on the north side of the road and located the line of the ditches on the three remaining sides as well as the north-east gateway, the north angle-tower and remains of two of the interior buildings. The fort was found to be a regular rectangle measuring 148 metres north-east and south-west by 101 metres. There were two defensive ditches in all the areas examined. The outer ditch was V-shaped, 2.2m wide and 1.0m deep. The inner ditch was a shallow U-shape, 3.8m wide and 1.0m deep. There was no surviving trace of the rampart, its position being indicated only by that of the post holes of the gate and corner towers. Finds were prolific, especially pottery, but also included coins, animal bones, quern-stones and a number of small finds. A human skull was found at the bottom of the inner ditch and a complete cow burial of pre-Roman date was found near the east corner. The finds indicate that the fort was founded around AD 70-71 and was occupied for only a short period. There was also evidence that the site was used as settlement in Saxon times. <1> SE 816 454 (centre). Roman auxiliary fort, SW of Hayton village, approximately 150 x 100m in size. Normal 'playing card' shape and apparently double-ditched defences, which are partially sealed below the modern lane. Many cropmarks can be seen in the vicinity of the fort area. The site has recently been excavated by Johnson (1975-76) and demonstrated to be Flavian in occupation and abandonment. <2> SE 8170 4548. Excavations in 1975 on the auxiliary fort uncovered barrack buildings and refuse pits inside the north angle. The north-west and south-east gates, with the north and north-eastern angle turrets were exposed and the defences were traced for much of their length. The dimensions within the inner of the two ditches 154 x 106m. No clear evidence of rebuilding found, the site apparently abandoned within the Flavian period. In a large area where no sign of Roman house buildings could be found, the bottom of a Grubenhaus came to light, containing several spindle whorls, a bone comb and sherds of severla late 5th century pots. An possible annexe, c.105 x 65 m (344.5 x 213.3 ft), with a rounded corner lies to the north-east. <3> SE 816 454.

Excavations on the first century fort, located from the air by Cambridge Auniversity photographers, were directed by J.S. Johnson for the Department of the Environment. The defences were traced for much of their length and the dimensions of the fort within the inner of the two ditches were found to be 154 by 106m. The north-west and south-east gates and the northern and north-eastern angle turrets were exposed. An area inside the northern angle revealed the beam-slots of timber barracks. The barrack building excavated was 8m wide and must originally have been about 34m long, though only traced for 23m because of the presence of the modern road. The space between the barracks, 5.5m wide, contained several rubbish pits, capped with gravel. There was no trace of widening of the barrack block at the rampart end for centurion's quarters, though partition slots, of which only slight traces survived, suggested that the commanding officer's quarters lay in that position. Nowhere was there any clear evidence of rebuilding during the life of the fort. The beam-slots and other small drainage features within the fort produced a good range of pottery. The site appears to have been abandoned within the Flavian period. In a large area where disturbance of the sandy subsoil failed to produce any sign of Roman timber buildings, the very bottom of a 'working hollow' or 'grubenhaus' of Saxon type came to light. This contained several spindle-whorls, a bone comb, and sherds of several late fifth-century pots, of both decorated and plain fabrics. <9> Aerial photograph showing the site of a Roman Fort and a moated site, DNR 1568/11. <10> Photocopied extract 'Excavations at Hayton Roman Fort, 1975' by S.

40023,SITE OF WEST FURZE LAKE DWELLING,CRANNOG,"Site of West Furze Lake Dwelling that was excavated in 1880-81 by Boynton and found to have had two periods of occupation, Neolithic and Late Bronze Age/Iron Age.","Aerial photograph of the site from the NMR. <1> 'The overlying platforms, 72ft east-west by 50ft north-south, of a two period lake dwelling, Neolithic and Late Bronze Age/Iron Age, cut by Skipsea Drain, was discovered and excavated 1880-81 by Boynton. The adjacent area had Iron Age/Romano-British occupation. The platforms lay on a peat layer over natural gravel which is 10ft below modern ground level. The construction was of a layer of brushwood overlain by large tree trunks and branches held together by piles inserted between them. The spaces were filled in with broken wood, the whole covered by a layer of sand and then 18ins of twigs and bark. On the north side were two straight rows of blunt pointed stakes, probably connecting both shores, with a single row at south facing upstream. The earliest occupation was characterized by piles sharpened by stone tools and the absence of pottery. The later occupation showed that the platform was extended beyond its earlier limits and the piles had been sharpened with metal tools. Associated with this occupation was a bronze socketed spearhead and pottery. Three human skulls were found at the eastern end of the excavated area, one being recognised as of Bronze Age type. Other finds from the platform included bone and antler tools, flint scrapers, hammer-stones, stone rubber, animal bones both wild and domestic, winged axe etc. About 20 yards south-east of the lake dwelling was a pit, 30ft long by 8ft wide, containing an Iron Age urn, height 26ins maximum circumference 6ft, now in British Museum; human skeletal remains, including skull; at higher level Roman pottery, including base of moratorium; 15ins to 18ins from top Medieval pottery.

In 1980 John Dent had already taken aerial photographs of the area around Garton Station and Kirkburn, round and square barrows along with other cropmarks were visible on the aerial photographs. A large enclosure was identified through aerial photographs and geophysics so excavations were concentrated around this feature. In September 1987 two open area excavations (Site 1, 1900sqm and Site 2 2,2250sqm) were opened. The stripping of Site 1 uncovered a series of  square and round barrows. A cart burial with a later Anglian Burial were identified along with two smaller round barrows, an undated quarry, linear ditches and medieval furrows . The stripping of Site 2 uncovered  a larger oval enclosure, linear ditches, a Bronze Age crouched inhumation, an Iron Age square enclosure, round barrow and early Roman horse burials. Neolithic to Roman pottery was identified along with other artefacts.

The wheels had been stacked leaning against the side of the grave, their decayed wooden naves and spokes replaced in clay. The pole and axle had been buried as a single T-shaped frame, 3.0m long and 2.2m across. The flexed corpse had been buried first and the framework of the vehicle lowered on top of it. The line of the yoke placed behind the body could be distinguished by a row of five terrets, the central one being finely decorated in relief. Alongside was a pair of linch pins and two horse pits; animal bones lay in front of and behind the shoulders of the body. A box shape, 1.7m by 1.0m, traced by darker filling above the skelton, may be the body of the chariot, upturned to cover it. Five smaller square barrows each had an unaccompanied north-south crouched burial in a large and deep grave. Four similar-sized barrows within ring ditches, two having causeways, had unusual features. The burials of males, one with a sword, another with a shield, all had iron spear or javelin heads thrust or thrown into the grave, 14 in that with a sword, and 11,7 and 3 in the others. Comparable finds have been made at Burton Fleming, Wetwang Slack and Grimthorpe. An enclosure 16-18m square with an entrance to the west is unique. No Iron Age grave was found within it but its centre was occupied by two rows of Anglian burials. Three other square barrows to the north-east, also had a western entrance and one had an extended east-west inhumation with a spearhead, but with an Anglian shield handle near the left hand. See also Current Archaeology 9 (1987), 234-7 and Anglo-Scandinavian Section. During excavations by I.M Stead thirty-five Anglian inhumation burials were discovered both at the centre of a large Iron Age enclosure, in three other Iron Age barrows, and elsewhere. Most were orientated east-west and grave goods indicate a 7th century date. A young child was accompanied by a fine gold pendant with filigree ornament, a silver toilet set, three silver rings and glass beads; a woman was buried with a brooch, pendant, bead and buckle, all of silver. A fine decorated hanging bowl had been missed by grave robbers. Other unusual graves included one with a bronze cauldron and support, and another with an iron ladle and a possible socketed weaving baton. Weapons were found in five graves and tools in two, knives came from eighteen and buckles from twelve graves. Bronze staples and iron fittings indicated wooden boxes or leather bags. Animal bones were found with twelve burials, usually at the feet. These burials were apparently an extension of Mortimer's Garton Gatehouse cemetery 500m to the east.

20000,"Iron Age and Romano-British occupation at Quarry Lodden, Bincombe",OCCUPATION SITE,"During construction of a gas pipeline in 1971 a deep layer of black soil, several pits and a number of crouched burials were seen by E Flatters. Subsequently a small excavation was carried out at the point where occupation seemed most dense. Several levels of floor interspersed with layers containing occupation debris, a pit and hearths were recorded. One floor appeared to be made partly of slabs of shale, which the excavators suggested may have been the floor of a narrow passage. Finds included an unfinished shale armlet and a fragment of another, leading to the suggestion that there may at some time have been shale working on the site.","In 1971 during construction of the trench for a gas pipeline passing east of Dorchester to the eastern end of Came Wood and then south-eastwards across the South Dorset Ridgeway along the spur to the west of Coombe Valley, Eric Flatters noticed an unusual depth of black soil east of Quarry Lodden. He also saw several pits and a number of crouched burials, one with a bowl of the so-called  war cemetery  type seen at Maiden Castle. Subsequently small excavation was carried out at the point where observations of the trench suggested that occupation was most dense. Two trenches 3m long and 1.5m wide were excavated parallel to the pipeline trench and about 5m from it on either side. In due course the northern trench was abandoned, and the southern one extended to a 3m by 3m square. Immediately below the ploughsoil was a small area of a floor constructed of flat stones packed with puddled chalk. No dating evidence was found, but the floor was interpreted as representing the remnants of a later Romano-British level, largely ploughed out.  An accumulation of dark soil overlay a floor of compacted limestone fragments. Pottery in this dark soil was Durotrigian and Romano-British. This floor sealed a pit, the fillings of which contained a little pottery. Below the floor was a partly broken up floor of stone and shale over a thick layer of black earth and stone over another floor of large stone slabs and a hearth of puddled chalk. Three slabs of shale were found, and the excavators speculated that these may have been the floor of a narrow passageway.  The black layer and ash from the hearth contained Iron Age B and early Durotrigian pottery. Below this was a series of alternating hearths with layers of ash, down to a layer over natural limestone. At this level Iron Age A pottery was found, with fabrics and forms comparable to those at Maiden Castle, Pins Knoll and Chalbury. This pottery included heamatite-coated situlate jars and derivative types, in fabric described as hard, occasionally burnished and varying in colour from bright red to dullish brown. Finds from the site included an unfinished shale armlet and a fragment of another, leading to speculation that there may at some time have been shale working on the site.  It is not clear from the report whether any other shale objects or waste were noted.

The first record is of a corbelled stone beehive chamber discovered in 1897, with a diameter of about 5ft. This chamber is alleged to have contained human remains (4 001 105 B) 2 yards away from it, an oblong chamber with rounded corners was found. It measures 7ft by 4 and a half ft and it was some 3ft high. It lay NNW to SSE, and was walled with Purbeck stone partly corbelled and closed with flat slabs. Within its rubble fill, numerous artefacts were retrieved, including sherds, a hammer-stone, flint flakes, slingstones, charred wood and shells. Another stone-lined beehive chamber , measuring 4 and a half ft high with a diameter of 5ft examined in 1898 had an arched entrance or passage on its N side 8ft long with a circular hole 4 and a half ft deep in its floor. This chamber contained Iron Age pottery, a rough mortar and a pebble pestle. A further two beehive chambers were identified in photographs.

Site consisted of possible field or enclosure boundaries, a circular structure of indeterminate function and a cremation area.  The urnfield comprised a baked clay hearth together with nine pits, one containing the base of a bucket urn and another a complete hearthstone quern. Acidic soils are likely to have precluded the survival of any cremated bone . Small quantities of late Bronze Age pottery were recovered from all pits, identified as bucket and globular urns typical of the Deverel Rimbury tradition. To the north an excavated structure, possibly a mortuary enclosure, may be associated with the cemetery.  A shallow circular gully with a diameter of 10.2m was also excavated with internal shallow scoops and possible postholes. Two external postholes may have been part of a porch. A north-south ditch was also excavated, 1.5m wide by 0.8m deep containing late Bronze Age pottery. A second east-west ditch separated the urnfield from the structure to the south.

20008,"Flagstones Neolithic enclosure, Dorchester",CAUSEWAYED ENCLOSURE,"A probable circular enclosure consisting of a single circuit of unevenly spaced pits constructed in the late 4th millennium cal. BC. There were two larger gaps in the circuit to the north and west. Four engravings were found on the sides of four segments and three primary burials (one cremation, the remainder inhumation) were placed in the base of segments, two beneath large stone slabs and the other close to another large stone. Another burial was cut into the primary fills of another segment.There is some suggestion for an earlier stone phase to this monument with a number of pits on the edge of the ditch segments and a large number of massive stones or deliberately broken fragments of stone in the fills of the segments.","A probably circular enclosure partly revealed by excavation at Flagstones by Wessex Archaeology in 1987-1988 in advance of the construction of the Dorchester By-pass and further parts by geophysical survey in 1992. The excavated area included slightly over half of the enclosure circuit and a further small part of the northeastern side was revealed by geophysical survey. The full circuit has not been determined.The following description is abstracted from the final published report on the site (1). The numbers in square brackets refer to context numbers quoted in the report.The enclosure is about 100m in diameter and is defined by a single discontinuous circuit of ovoid pits [00399], some of them intercutting. The segments were unevenly spaced with many intercutting pits in the northwest and southwest parts of the excavated circuit and with causeways generally 0.5-2.5m wide between pits elsewhere. There were two wider gaps in the circuit to the north and to the west, perhaps denoting entrances. A total of 39 segments were exposed by the excavation and these were generally between 1.3-3m wide, 2-5.75m long and 0.75-1.4m deep with steep, almost vertical, sides and flat bottoms. The two pits (segments 35 & 36) each side of the wide gap in the north side of the circuit were very shallow with bowl-shaped profiles. The location of four further pits was found by geophysical survey in the area behind Max Gate House. Shallow engravings were found in four of the pits in the north, northwest, south and southwest parts of the circuit (segments 4, 12, 28, 34). These engravings comprised series of curvilinear lines, criss-cross patterns or more complex shapes (2). In common with many other features at Flagstones, there was a large amount of intrusive material found in this monument, largely a result of considerable root and animal disturbance.Primary burials were placed on the base of three segments. The cremated remains of an adult beneath a large sarsen slab were found in segment 16 in the west. Close by in segment 19 were the remains of a child inhumation beneath a large slab of calcareous sandstone. In the west terminal of segment 30 in the north was the crushed skeleton on a 6-12 month old child and the femur of a 3-5 year old. These were not under a slab but a large sarsen fragment was found nearby. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from human bone and antler from the base of the pits gave a late 4th millenium BC date.Most of the segments appear to have filled rapidly and naturally with vacuous chalk rubble containing few finds. These included some earlier Neolithic bowl sherds, worked flint, 5 antler picks, a chalk ball, and a number of fragments of sarsen, limestone and sandstone with fresh breaks and some with signs of burning. The right femur of an adult was also recovered from the primary fill. Animal bone was mainly red deer with some cattle and dog bone. A pit was cut into the primary fills of segment 14 for the burial of a 10-12 year old child inhumation. A late 3rd millenium BC radiocarbon date was obtained from this skeleton. Above the primary fills was a stabilisation layer followed by weathering of the sides and further silting. A few finds were found in the stabilisation layer including 6 sherds of Neolithic bowl, one sherd of Late Iron Age/Roman pot, 19 pieces of worked flint, a small quantity of animal bone.  A grape pip was found in the stabilisation layer in segment 38. This produced a radiocarbon date of AD1640-1950. Finds from the silting layers above included Bronze Age flint (concentrated in the northwest part of the enclosure), 17 abraded sherds of Neolithic bowl, seven sherds of Late Iron Age pottery, four medieval sherds and small quantities of ceramic building material, fired clay, slag, and stone. 23 fragments of animal bone included cattle, horse,and red deer. The crouched inhumation of an adult male was found in segment 2 cut through the stabilisation layer. Fragments of human bone were also found in the silting layers of segment 28.The enclosure segments were finally filled with an upper layer of brown soil which was cut by Late Iron Age features. Finds were more productive from this layer than the earlier layers. They included a large quantity of Bronze Age flint, 42 sherds of Neolithic bowl, one Bronze Age sherd, 167 Late Iron Age sherds and 27 medieval and post-medieval sherds. Other finds included ceramic building material, shale waste, a fragment of copper alloy sheet and a coin of Constantine II. Fragments of human bone were also recovered and 127 fragments of animal bone, principally cattle.Mollusc data indicates a transition from grazed grassland at the time of construction to a combination of tillage and pasture within an increasingly open landscape.There is some suggestion of an earlier monument preceding the segmented enclosure. A number of small pits were found which had been cut by segments of the enclosure. These may represent stoneholes from an earlier monumental stone setting. There was a notable concentration of large stones and stone fragments in the enclosure segments which distinguishes this monument from other monuments nearby. And another large sarsen slab was found in the garden of Max Gate immediately to the west in 1891 (3). The stones may have been broken up or reused for burial when the segmented enclosure was constructed. The date of this postulated monument is not clear but stratigraphically, the indications are that it was not much earlier in date."
20009,A37 Western Link; Late Iron Age/ Early Roman Cemetery Structure 929,POST BUILT STRUCTURE,"Evidence for a Late Iron Age/ Early Roman cemetery structure was discovered during excavations along the route of the Dorchester By-pass, Western Link.

A drainage gully was also excavated behind the structure. Pottery from the fills contained 2nd century and later Roman pottery. The structure was surrounded by at least 14 burials, which appear to have been deliberately set around it, mostly to the west. It is likely that this represents a funerary structure in use until at least the latter part of the 2nd century, at which time burials ceased.","Found during a programme of archaeological work conducted by Wessex Archaeology along the route of the Dorchester By-pass, Western Link, Fordington Bottom, Dorchester between 1986 and 1988.

The numbers in square brackets below refer to the context and feature numbers used in the published report (1).24 graves or possible graves are assigned to this period, from which the remains of 15 skeletons were recovered.

No contemporary settlement structures were identified in the area at this time. Two almost parallel narrow gullies [910] & [989] may have formed a cemetery boundary. These gullies could not be traced into Trench G/H but followed the alignment of the graves and enclosed an area around structure [929].Structure [929] was rectangular in plan and aligned NE-SW along the coombe side at the southern end of Trench K. The main structure measured 4.6m x 2m and was defined by a series of beam slots and surrounded by seven post-holes, four to the front and three to the rear, possibly supporting the roof and a veranda. A drainage gully was also excavated behind the structure. All the features were shallow (<0.2m deep) and had been disturbed by ploughing. Pottery from the beam slot fills suggests that the building was in use for a considerable time, it included 2nd century and later Roman pottery. The structure was surrounded by at least 14 burials, which appear to have been deliberately set around it, mostly to the west.

20011,"Iron Age settlement on Southdown Ridge, Weymouth",UNENCLOSED SETTLEMENT,"An Iron Age settlement recorded during excavations in 2008-2009 in advance of construction of the Weymouth Relief Road. Road construction affected only the western edge of the settlement, which may have been very much larger.","The settlement was established in the period c. 800-600 BC, the very earliest Iron Age, and appears not to have been enclosed at this time. It is not clear if the adjacent cross dyke was already in existence at this period, as dating evidence is inconclusive. The earliest activity on the site was the construction of at least one circular structure (7688); the excavators noted that there may have been other similar structures in adjacent unexcavated areas. This early settlement was greatly disturbed by later activity. The circular structure (7688) was situated at the south-western edge of the settlement, and consisted of a discontinuous curved gully marking part of a circular building around 13 metres in diameter. Postholes inside the gully suggested internal supports or partitions. Two large postholes formed a south-east facing entrance, and several postholes outside the entrance may have supported a porch. The filling of one of the postholes of the doorway contained earliest-early Iron Age pottery, as well as flecks of charcoal, slag and animal bone fragments. Quantities of heat-magnetised waste suggest that industrial activity may have been carried out in the vicinity. A fragment of shale armlet was also found, suggesting shale working on the site during this early phase of occupation. A well-preserved stretch of gully revealed evidence of construction methods   the base and sides of the gully were lined with slabs of limestone, which would have supported timber wall posts and/or planks. The positions of the doorway and porch postholes suggested that the doorway may have been realigned at some stage. Some of the postholes in this area were sealed by a layer of limestone pieces, forming a paved area. Several pieces of animal bone had been driven into the ground around the edge of this paved area, perhaps to secure stakes or a hide or textile cover. The paved area was covered by a rich deposit flecked with charcoal and containing fragments of pottery and animal bone, which spread beyond the paved area, and up to and into the top of the gully. The excavators felt that one possible explanation of this was that at the end of its life the building had been modified for use as an outdoor working area. Inside the building a shallow irregular hollow was filled with heat-magnetised material and a small oval stone-lined pit within the building contained a fragment of smithing hearth. A further indication of industrial use was the presence of shale waste in two of the postholes associated with this structure. A yard area next to this structure had quantities of occupation debris trampled into its surface, apparently re-deposited occupation or midden debris. including fuel ash slag, pottery, and fragments of an unfinished or failed casting of a copper alloy socketed axe, which may have been a deliberate deposition for votive purposes. The pottery included red-finished oolitic wares, furrowed bowls, jars with linear incised decoration and finger-impressed jars, of the late Bronze Age to early Iron Age transition. The decorated examples correspond stylistically to forms dated to the 8th-7th centuries BC at Kimmeridge. Animal bones in this layer represented various species, predominantly cattle but including sheep/goat, pig, and a dog. A flint shale working tool was also found in this layer, but may have been intrusive.Pits and postholes around the edges of the early Iron Age farm suggest that it may have been enclosed by an arrangement of fences that may have functioned in conjunction with the cross dyke. Unfortunately levelling of the site in the late Iron Age made it difficult to discern clearly the stratigraphic relationships between these various features. At an early stage, the southern side of the settlement was enclosed by a ditch and fence or palisade, possibly at the same time. Another fence line ran from the northern end of the cross dyke to a pit alignment on the northern side of the farm, which may have served as a boundary marker, as well as for storage. The excavators speculated that the fact that the fences were not replaced by an earthwork enclosure could suggest that settlement was not continuous and that there was a break in occupation of uncertain length, probably in the middle Iron Age.In the late Iron Age a terrace was cut into the scarp slope at the northern end of the settlement, cutting the ditch of an earlier penannular enclosure, and indicating that the enclosure must have been abandoned by this stage. The terrace was was around 8.5m wide and 0.60m high and reinforced by a stone revetment wall, but does not seem to have been the foundation of a building. It may have been erected to define a space, possibly for a small building or buildings which were subsequently robbed and/or truncated by later activity. In spite of this disturbance it was clear to the excavator s that this terraced area accommodated a complex of features including a double stone-lined drain, a single drain, and a paved path lined with low walls and a small alcove. The terrace was cobbled and re-surfaced or patched at least twice. Occupation material overlying the cobbles contained a few sherds of middle-late Iron Age pottery. The revetment wall was of dry-stone construction, surviving to a height of four courses, of roughly-shaped and unmodified limestone blocks and slabs. Some of the stones in the wall were burnt. Finds recovered from the yellowish-brown clayey silt filling between the stones included body sherds of a middle or late Iron Age burnished vessel in Poole Harbour ware, but also residual sherds more typical of early Iron Age date. A deposit formed largely of stone tumbled from the front of the wall contained pottery sherds dominated by Poole Harbour wares, including a late Iron Age necked jar and cordoned ovoid jar. The terraced area appeared to have been re-organised while in use and was disturbed and truncated by later activity. This made it difficult to interpret the date, function and character of the complex, not least whether it accommodated a structure of any sort. However, the excavators felt that the terrace might have been created as a level, drained space in which various domestic or craft activities might be carried out, probably during the late Iron Age. A concentration of shale working waste, including offcuts and bracelet/armlet fragments, was found in a soil layer overlying the stony spread, and suggesting that a shale workshop was situated somewhere in the complex. In the very late Iron Age, probably during the 1st century AD, the nucleus of the settlement was levelled using stone robbed from earlier buildings and midden-like material brought from elsewhere, possible from part of the settlement outside the excavated area.  This midden like deposit (7002) was thick, varied but highly organic, and sealed several late Iron Age burials. The purpose of the levelling was unclear but seemed to mark the return of the area to agricultural use."
10000,"FORE DOWN - Bronze Age cairn cemetery, Bronze Age barrow",CAIRN CEMETERY,"Possible site of a barrow group, excavated by Croft Andrew c1942.","On the steep, south facing slope of Fore Down, there formerly existed a group of  barrows or cairns. The approximate location of the group is indicated on a map of Dudley, but she did not know their exact number or locations. She states that CK Croft Andrew excavated here, that Patchett saw the pots, and that the downland they were in was enclosed during WWII (b1). Patchett, who had information from Croft Andrew, describes the urn discovered here as markedly biconical, with large handles and with a carination at handle level. The pot had a slight cordon at the neck, and an everted rim with very slanting internal bevel. The impressed cord ornament consisted of four horizontal lines and a band of chevrons. A dagger was associated (b2). In 1973, the OS fieldworker could provide no further insights into these barrows either through fieldwork or documentary research (h2). The finds are listed by Pearce (b3) and illustrated by Christie who records that the finds, a handled urn, a dagger and a flint, were rescued by Croft Andrew from the mutilated barrow during his Davidstow Moor campaign, and which are now in Truro Museum (b4, 5, 6).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1973.

10002,"TRETHELLAN FARM - Bronze Age burial, Bronze Age round house (domestic)",ROUND HOUSE (DOMESTIC),One of seven MBA roundhouses set along a broad south-west facing terrace at Trethellan Farm.,"Trethellan Bronze Age village comprised at least seven roundhouses which were set in a row along a broad south-west facing terrace. House 2222 was sealed beneath several layers of soil which produced large quantities of pottery. Discovered late in the excavation,  the history of occupation appeared to have been relatively straightforward, and the house was excavated rapidly. The house was set in a circular hollow, c11m in diameter; it consisted of a single ring of closely-set post holes and traces of a stone wall revetting the hollow. A total of 228 stake holes were recorded in the interior. Several phases of activity were identified, each differing only slightly, and not representing any major change in patterns of use or construction. A well sealed deposit from the central hearth gave a Carbon-14 date centred on 3091 BP (uncalibrated) (2).The incomplete remains of an extended adult male inhumation were discovered in a rectangular pit, 1.8m long, aligned north-east/south-west, in the build-up of the layers in the central hearth.  The hearth was clearly re-used after this interment.

In Henderson's time, finds from the clearance which included stone querns, could be seen at Lower Bussow, as well as in the surviving huts. The remains of the settlement may also be associated with burials, as Henderson also mentions urn fragments and ashes were found in a stone cist (see also 31479) (b2). A field system is associated with the settlement and is centred at SW 4976 3869. It is best defined in the moorland enclosure around the huts as a series of lynchets up to 1.0m high. The present fields to the south and east are bounded by modern walls and utilise lynchets (h1). There are now no traces of the querns either at Lower Bussow or within the huts (h1).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1961. QUINNELL, NV / OS2: 1975. FLETCHER, MJ / OS--------------------------------<MCO911>: Henderson listed a ring barrow at Bussow in Towednack (now in St Ives)(b4). In his ms, he recorded a stone cist containing fragments of two urns, ashes and some polished stone querns. These remains were probably associated with a hut circle settlement and field system (see also PRN 31478). In Henderson's time, the urn fragments were in the possession of the farmer (b2) but by 1922, fragments of three urns had been presented to the RIC (b3). Patchett identified somne of this material as a late BA class F (ribbon handle and overhanging rim tradition)(b5, b6).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1961.

10004,"CHYSAUSTER - Bronze Age cairn, Bronze Age cup marked stone",CUP MARKED STONE,"An excavated cairn initially interpreted as a hut circle. The cairn was the focus for a number of cremations, six of which were associated with urns of Middle Bronze Age date.","A cairn on the slopes above Chysauster was initially interpreted as a hut circle in the 1950s during a survey by the OS. A subsequent OS visit in 1975 cast doubt on this interpretation; the surveyor then suggesting that it was in fact a clearance cairn. Excavation and survey by CAU and the CEU in 1984 proved it to be a Bronze Age funerary cairn. The monument is sited within a later IA/RB field system (36007.7). Excavations revealed a kerbed cairn, over 6m in diameter, comprising large granite blocks, each with one natural approximately flat surface and most of similar height, placed in position so that the flat faces made up the outer perimeter of a quite accurate circle; an apparent entrance c2m wide was incorporated on its south side. The body of the cairn was made up of sub-angular granite blocks laid mainly horizontally to produce a flattened top, level with the tops of the kerb stones. The exposed surface of one of the top stones of the infill, close to the possible entrance gap had a pecked cup-mark. The cairn was the focus for a number of cremations (9), six of which were associated with urns. The cairn had several structural phases. Within the main central body two adjacent features contained urned cremation burials and appear to have been the primary burials around which the cairn was designed. Placed outside the cairn kerb were a further six irregularly spaced satellite burials, four of which contained complete pots. Two further pits, shallow and truncated by ploughing, were located north-east of the cairn kerb with one containing a fragment of pottery.Finds included Trevisker style cremation urns, worked flint debitage, an amber bead, an ovoid slate disc, quartz crystals and a worked pebble (b7). A buried soil sampled from beneath the kerbed stones, provided a calibrated radiocarbon date 2280-1780BC. Radiocarbon dates from the cremation urns showed the monument to have been in use during the  Middle Bronze Age with the period c1800-1500 cal BC proposed as the bracket in which it was at one time built and used (b7). The site was reinstated after excavation and now sits in an area of enclosed croft (h4).Charcoal (Quercus sp.) was extracted from the top of the old land surface beneath cairn 38, context OLS 534 (7). The charcoal occurred over a fairly wide area and was scattered; ie it was not just a result of a small fire but may be the result of clearance of the woodland prior to the construction of the cairn. Radiocarbon dating from an oak sample from this deposit returned a date of 3650 80 BP (HAR-6548) - current calibration provides a date of 2_: 2280-1770 cal BC (b9).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1960.

A cremation and beaker vessel contained within a cist were recovered.","A standing stone is recorded at Trye on current OS maps (b9). It was excavated by Pool and Russell in 1958 and 1962 (h1, h3) and subsequent reports appeared in Proceedings of the West Cornwall Field Club and Cornish Archaeology (b1-b4). Excavation showed that the menhir stood by a cairn of stones, below which was a cremation and a beaker vessel contained within a cist (31514.01). The menhir was erected before the cist but it is probable that they form a single monument. Sherds found on the surrounding soil suggest the insertion of secondary burials which have since been scattered by ploughing (b4). The standing stone is of triangular section, tapering upwards. At the base, the sides are 0.6m wide and the stone is 2.5m high. There are no surface remains of the cairn (h2). Pool and Russell record that the west side of the pit containing the menhir had been disturbed by a later horse burial (31514.02).

Pool and Russell record that the cist was c1.0m east of the menhir and was formed by four granite blocks set on edge, covered by a single capstone which was in turn covered by a cairn and loose stones. Within the cist was a handled beaker found lying intact on its site (this vessel is illustrated by Clarke in b7). Fragments of cremated bone were scattered throughout. The filling and two unburnt long bones were found on the paved floor. A few beaker and Middle Bronze Age sherds were found in the cist and cairn, and amongst the cairn stones was a saddle quern (b3). Another pit was found to the south west of the cist. This contained beaker sherds and was also sealed by a capstone. Both the cist and the separate pit  were covered by the cairn and are therefore presumed to be contemporary (b4). The cist remains underground (b8).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1960. QUINNELL, NV / OS--------------------------------"

It is slightly oval in plan and measures 11.7m by 10.2m. The circle comprises eight stones, seven of which are still standing; the northernmost stone has fallen and lies broken. All the stones are quartz and vary in height between 1.0m and 2.4m. The stone circle was reconstructed in the mid 1800s (7)WC Borlase relates two conflicting stories about the urn which was found at this site. In an account of the attempt in 1861 to re-erect three (?) fallen stones, credited to one Mr Pedlar, the urn was recovered from beneath one of the stones. A fragment of this urn is illustrated by Borlase. However, Mr NHP Lawrence of Launceston subsequently stated in a letter (to TH Bewes and seen by Borlase) that the urn was recovered from a hedge that bisected the circle when this was removed, either before 1858 or between 1861-63. Human bone was found inside the urn. Borlase inferred from these details that a burial monument or cairn had been raised inside the circle.Patchett (1946) lists the urn as Class 'G' Deverel-Rimbury style which she ascribes to the Late Bronze Age and dates to ""after 750 BC"".The circle is in excellent condition but recent plans to make the farm into a tourist attraction might disturb the nature of the site.The stone circle was plotted from aerial photographs (p1) during the Cornwall NMP.--------------------------------Site history:1: 1971.

10007,"HARLYN BAY - Bronze Age round house (domestic), Iron Age cemetery",ROUND HOUSE (DOMESTIC),"An Iron Age cemetery with over 100 graves, part of a walled structure and lots of artefacts were revealed by excavations at Harlyn Bay in 1900 and 1976","During site works in advance of the construction of a house at Harlyn Bay in 1900, the remains of an Iron Age cemetery were revealed. An excavation was undertaken by Mr Reddie Mallett (apparently the owner of the site) (b1), and about 110 graves were discovered. Part of a curved wall was also found,  with two burials found beneath its foundation, which were interpreted as 'votive offerings' (b9). The other burials were in graves  aligned N-S, with the head at the north, and the bodies were crouched or contracted (b1,9). The interments (not cremations) were accompanied by a range of bronze, iron and ceramic grave goods (b5,9). The 'excavation archive' now held by the Royal Cornwall Museum, in Truro (b8), consists of the excavator's notes and a guidebook written by Mr Buller in 1912 (b3), which is extremely confused. Finds from the excavation of the cemetery at Harlyn Bay in 1900 are listed separately in records detailing metalwork, pottery, stone, bone and shell because of the difficulty of associating individual finds with particular graves or excavated contexts 21700.3-.6). It appears from the original excavation archive notes that only a few of the burials had grave goods, and of those found it is not clear what proportion eventually found their way to Truro Museum.  In 1976, the site was re-examined by Rowan Whimster when the  building that had been used as a museum was to be extended into a bungalow (b9). Although only a small area was excavated, the written and artefactual archives were re-examined and it was possible to clarify the interpretation of the site. However, the site archive contained details of only 40 of  the burials - the other 70 remain unlocated. The main feature revealed by Whimster was a length of drystone walling set on a clay-bonded foundation course dug into the old ground surface (b9). This was considered to be part of the same feature as that seen in 1900, which was interpreted as part of a  'ritual structure',  a conclusion accepted by Whimster.  This feature was deliberately demolished not long after construction. No new burials were found, and only one pit  from the 1900 excavations was encountered.  Because the acid soils of Cornwall destroy all traces of bone, this site, inundated by dune sand, is one of the few with surviving human skeletal material making it  one of  the most important prehistoric sites in the county.Charcoal samples from the floor of the circular building and from an old land surface prior to the inundation of the site by dune sand both gave dates in the Middle Bronze Age. The circular structure (house?) was dated to 3320-3600 BP (1820-2100 BC) and the OLS to 3460-3640 BP (1960-2140 BC).  The circular structure therefore appears to be a middle Bronze Age round house rather than an Iron age 'ritual structure'.  This highlights doubts about the accuracy of the 1900 excavation archive and also about whether Whimster's wall and the 1900 wall are in fact parts of the same structure. It also recalls Nowakowskis' discovery at Trethellan Farm,Newquay, of  Iron Age burials over the remains of a  Bronze Age village (PRN 171472).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954. ALFR/ OS3: 1970. MJF/ OS5: 1985. SHEPPARD PA/DOE--------------------------------<MCO704>: A number of stone objects were found with the burials in the 1900 excavation at Harlyn Bay. Parts of two thin shale bracelets were found, presumably imported from southern Britain. Four small tools had been made from the rather soft local slate, including a  20cm long knife, two needles and a borer. These could not have been used to work any hard material but may have been used for net-making for example.  Other slate pieces were found that could also have possibly been utilised.  These objects are very unusual and without close parallel in Cornwall.Seven spindle whorls, made from pottery, stone, slate and bone were found. It has been assumed that they came singly from female graves, though there is no evidence for this. Spindle whorls are rarely found in Iron Age graves,There were also a number of sharpened bits of shell, possibly used for sewing or for dealing with shellfish. Three lumps of ochre were found. There were a number of pebbles possibly used for sling stones, and there were six bits of flint of unknown date, presumably residual. Animal bones were found in and around the cists, including ox, sheep, horse and pig.  Hencken says that mice bones found in a child's grave may have been intrusive rather than ritual objects.--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954. ALFR/ OS3: 1970. MJF/ OS5: 1979.

Whimster suggests that  few were associated with the burials, but instead came from a cooking midden at the southern edge of the site. Most of the pottery was well fired Iron Age or Romano-British wares, including a few sherds of South-West decorated ware 'similar to that found at Glastonbury'. One sherd was found close to the mouth of one of the interments and may have been used as an amulet (b9).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954. ALFR/ OS3: 1970. MJF/ OS5: 1979. SHEPPARD PA/ DOE6: 1985. SHEPPARD PA/ DOE--------------------------------<MCO19614>: Curving sections of stone wall revealed by excavations at Harlyn Bay in 1900  were interpreted as part of a round house or circular ritual structure. The drystone wall was set on  heavy clay-bonded  foundation slabs. The foundation was set in a trench cut into the old ground surface, and the wall was revetted with soil layers.  It was reported that the bones of  two individuals were found crushed under one of the foundation slabs. Bullen (b3) thought that the wall was part of the cemetery's perimeter wall, but the more popular explanation was that this was  part of a hut or ritual structure, and that the burials were some kind of votive offering.  In 1976, the site was re-examined by Rowan Whimster when the  building, which had been used as a museum, was due to be extended into a bungalow (b9). Although only a small area was excavated, the written and artefactual archives were re-examined at the same time and it was possible to clarify the interpretation of the site. The main feature revealed by Whimster was a length of walling which was considered to be part of the same feature as that seen in 1900, which was interpreted as a  'ritual structure',  a conclusion accepted by Whimster.  This feature was deliberately demolished not long after construction. No new burials were found, and only one pit  from the 1900 excavations was encountered.  The structure produced a range of artefacts including two sherds of black fabric, ""possibly from an earlier phase of occupation of the site"", a couple of flints, probably residual, and fragments of bone of horse, pig, ox and duck (b9). This reflects the range of bones found in the rest of the cemetery (b1). The two bodies buried under the wall of the structure were found to have three fragments of an iron bracelet and a bronze ring. Sadly there seems to be no  illustrations of these finds and their present location is unknown. Charcoal samples from the floor of the circular building and from an old land surface prior to the inundation of the site by dune sand both gave dates in the Middle Bronze Age. The circular structure (house?) was dated to 3320-3600 BP (1820-2100 BC) and the OLS to 3460-3640 BP (1960-2140 BC).  The circular structure therefore appears to be a middle Bronze Age round house rather than an Iron age 'ritual structure'.  This highlights doubts about the accuracy of the 1900 excavation archive and also about whether Whimster's wall and the 1900 wall are in fact parts of the same structure. It also seems unlikely that the two skeletons could actually have come from beneath the wall of the structure.--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954. ALFR/ OS3: 1970. MJF/ OS5: 1979. SHEPPARD PA/ DOE6: 1985. SHEPPARD PA/ DOE--------------------------------In 1900, about 130 graves were excavated in the Iron Age cemetery at Harlyn Bay. Records  exist for less than 50 of them, consisting usually of only a rough location plan and a small sketch (b1). Most of the graves were aligned N-S, apparently in rows,  although some were cut into earlier burials. The graves were all stone lined, and mainly rectangular; heads were generally at the north  end. The grave cuts were  just large enough for a crouched or contracted adult and smaller graves were interpreted as children's. The alignment of the heads to the north is indicative of Iron Age interments.  A few burials were in oval or irregular graves, and some were in double graves. One 'family' burial had been disturbed by a later  addition.The skeletons were not well recorded, but included men and women, family grouos and seven children (unusual in such cemeteries). Although pathological features were not recorded, some  information on burial customs was recovered. Bullen describes one area as  being full of mixed bones, possibly a charnel house for bone fragments found during later interments. There was a group of disturbed burials in cists to the south of the others. Two cists contained collections of skulls,  one with five, the other with three in a line facing west. One skull lay at the foot of its skeleton, and one burial had sword cuts to the skull.--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954. ALFR/ OS3: 1970. MJF/ OS5: 1979. SHEPPARD PA/ DOE6: 1985.

It remains uncertain what finds were removed from this midden, and whimster has suggested that the pottery allegedely  found in the graves may in fact have come from this midden. Bullen's report suggests that slate and shell implements, and spindle whorls of various materials were found in the midden, but these were described by whimster as being from the burials. It is not certain whether the midden is connected with the cemetary at all, and it may represent the periphery of a settlement  site of any iron age date.

10008,"TREGIFFIAN - Neolithic, Early Bronze Age entrance grave",CUP MARKED STONE,"Remains of a barrow with an entrance passage, found during excavation to incorporate cup marked stones and to contain cremated bone and an undamaged urn.","Tregiffian barrow is situated approx 100m to the SE of Goon Rith Menhir (28191) and 260m SW of the Merry Maidens stone circle (28200).  It was first recorded by WC Borlase in 1863 (b1) and was 'opened' by him in 1868. Having removed the turf from the mound he observed that ""it became quite evident that that....stones had been taken from it to make the surrounding hedges and their place supplied by a pile of mud and refuse from the road"" so it is difficult to be certain about the original form and ground plan of the monument.  He recorded a ring of perimeter stones and a large inclined capstone 2.7m in diameter and 0.45m thick resting on two uprights at the south and west sides and on the ground on the other side, having apparently been knocked of its supports by what he (probably mistakenly) identified as a menhir. He recorded a great quantity of ashes and bone splinters and a flint flake, but no pottery or metalwork (b2). Henderson gave the position of the barrow, which he said is still visible, as adjoining the hedge and some 90m west of the stile leading to the Merry Maidens field, and noted that the menhir referred to by Borlase had disappeared (b3). The OS surveyed the barrow at 1:2500 in 1960 and recorded the remains of the SE half of a mound which resembled a barrow. This had a maximum height of 2.0m and a diameter of approx 17m which had been augmented by the dumping of field clearance material on the NE and SW. They also recorded that the barrow was cut across by a NE- SW hedge and that there were no traces of a mound on the road verge to the NW of the hedge (h1). Tregiffian barrow was excavated by Dorothy Dudley for the MPBW in 1967 and 1968; she recorded that the barrow may have originally been 12m in diameter. A megalithic passage 4.3m long and 1.2m wide was discovered, surrounded by a setting of large granite slabs 0.9m to 1.2m high, at about 0.9m from the outer edge of this passage. The stones blocking the entrance, one of them cup marked, had been displaced by Borlase. Slightly east of the entrance a 1.1m square granite block, covered with a whole group of cup marks had been set at an angle to the entrance (28192.2). Another large cup marked stone was found lying in the SE quadrant. The floor of the passage was strewn with comminuted bone fragments and below this floor were two pits. An oval one contained charcoal, stone and cremated bone, and a round one held an undamaged urn 38cm high (h2, h3, b4, b5). A further excavation  was carried out by A Apsimon for the DOE, in 1972, to supplement Dudley's work in 1967/68. This  was confined to the completion of the plan of the chamber prior to conservation and restoration (h4, b7). Russell in 1971 listed the site and recorded the extant remains of a barrow with a stone structure (b6). Sheppard in 1982 noted that the ground on each side of the outer ring of stones had been eroded by visitors. The bare strips were approx 3.6m long by 0.6m wide (b8). The entrance grave is visible on aerial photographs. The monument was included in the Schedule on 9/12/1968 and the scheduling revised on 20/2/1996.--------------------------------Site history:1: 1960. QUINNELL, NV /OS--------------------------------"
10009,CONSTANTINE ISLAND - Iron Age hut circle,HUT CIRCLE,Two Iron Age hut circles on Constantine Island.,"Constantine Island is a small peninsula 35m by 15m in size divided from the land at high tide and now suffering much erosion. The top is said to be a raised beach but this may be an illusion as the sand that spreads over the whole area has also been deposited here. In the early C20 the remains of two huts and a cremation with grave goods, were found. There are now negligible remains apart from an underlying layer of flints (21721), probably a scatter from the many well-preserved midden deposits (21730.6 and 21731). The huts and cremation were dated to the La Tene Iron Age, and probably form part of the settlement found close to the island on the mainland (21731).

JP Arthur claims the bones were ""arranged in a neat little heap between two small slabs of slate"" (b1) but also has suggested a story about cannibalism following Williams observation that the bones seemed to have been cut up after death; a later specialist report clearly showed the error of this idea but continued by claiming that the body was female, of 5ft 5in height. Claims of this sort  are impossible to substantiate from bones in such poor condition. Some sherds of a black hand made pot were found in the cist, with some flint flakes and a worked piece of quartzite. The site could not be definitely located, but may have lain within one of two hollows on the island that may be the result of excavations (b10).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1901.

Above and to the southwest a larger flat laid slate slab  rests  upon the upright stones. The arrangement of stones and their position within aeolian deposits suggests a built structure and the most likely interpretation is that these stones represent a cist burial. This is likely to date to the Early Bronze Age. The cist, although visible in the cliff edge, is not at any immediate risk from erosion since it lies on the leeward side of the island. The ground around it is covered with thick grassy vegetation and this is preventing erosion on the scale apparent elsewhere on the island (b1).<MCO46105>: A polished granite implement was recovered during a field survey from an eroding cliff face on the northwestern side of Constantine Island (b1). The tool had been broken in antiquity and the sub-oval fragment recovered measured 11cm by 4cm along its longest face and tapered to a width of 2cm. It has been identified as a lapstone (Carl Thorpe pers comm) used for polishing leather. It is likely to be of prehistoric origin. The stone came from a pocket of the midden material covering the island at a depth of 0.4m below the surface. Numerous fragments of burnt bone were also recovered from the vicinity of the lapstone within the same deposit. The stratigraphy here seemed disturbed in comparison with the well-stratified midden material to either side, perhaps indicating an intrusion into the midden. This might indicate a cist burial eroding out of the cliff, and thus a Bronze Age date, although no structural features were observed. The artefact has been returned to the NT warden for the Holywell Bay - Camel Estuary area.<MCO25848>: In 1902 Penrose Williams reported the discoverey of a cist on Constantine Island (PRN21730.3). A deposit of similar bones were found nearby, in the same condition. He suggested that they were of a similar origin, but had been discarded by the finder as being of no interest.

Towards the centre lay a fairly deep pit containing a cremation in a decorated urn. The urn had been broken either before or during the act of depostion and the pit had been sealed with a black silty layer. Close by was a large quartz block embedded in the clay subsoil - possibly a marker stone. The cremation was found to include a bronze awl among the bone fragments.

SHEPPARD, PA / DOE--------------------------------<MCO1652>: Edmunds in 1848 records the find of two urns at the foot of Tresvennack Pillar (28707) in 1840 by JNR Millett. Perhaps the largest sepulchural urn in Cornwall, was found covered by a granite slab 0.46m square and 5cm thick. The urn is 49.5cm high, 35.5cm wide at the top with a maximum diameter of 39.4cm and 19.0cm wide at the base, with two massive handles. It was found standing on its base 0.9m east of the menhir in a vault 0.9m square without any kind of cist. The pit was infilled with wood ashes and fragments of human bone, whilst larger bones and a human molar tooth were found within the vessel. A small urn half filled with a fine snuff-coloured powder and standing on its base was discovered at the same time 0.46m to the north-east of the former (b1). The urns are mentioned by WC Borlase (b2) and by Hencken (b3) and are listed by Patchett as Middle Bronze Age overhanging rim urns, now in Penzance Museum (b4). Russell in 1971 lists the find in her entry for Tresvennack Pillar (b5).<see MCO7536 for collated record>"
10014,CONSTANTINE BAY - Iron Age hut circle settlement,HUT CIRCLE SETTLEMENT,"Remains of and Iron Age settlement, excavated in he early C20.","The remains found on the mainland opposite Constantine Is land are just as confusing as those on the island. The records kept of excavations and finds were not adequate, and it remains uncertain whether one or two huts were found, as the locations of finds remains unclear. In fact it seems that Arthur's reports (b2) led to most of the confusion as he may have mixed  features on the island with those on the mainland. His unreliability has been noted in regard to the island remains (921730) and the aspects in which he has caused confusion will be detailed on the sub records below. It is clear that the site lies on and in an extensive midden deposit, in which both bones and shells and an urn and a piece of bronze were found in the layers. A hut was built on the midden layers and was subsequently partly covered by further layers of midden material; it was well excavated and beautifully drawn by Penrose Williams. It was quite obviously round, but there are reports by Arthur of at least one, and possibly two, other huts, one of which was pear-shaped (like the hut on Constantine Island). The other had only one wall, one having fallen away with the cliff (like a feature on the island). He describes the latter as containing a hearth, however, unlike the island one. He also mentions a small cist enclosing grass seeds, some of which were apparently grown. This is a highly improbable result from Iron Age grass seeds kept in a damp environment. It seems likely that Arthur's comments were made from second or third hand reports, and it is hard to know what value to place on his comments. The problems were exacerbated when a field study in 2003 identified new locations for sites in addition to the sites already mapped from antiquitarian sources (b9).(b7) - Johnson, ND, 1980, Pers Comm to SMR--------------------------------Site history:2: 1970. HAT / OS3: 1980. NDJ / CCRA--------------------------------<MCO19366>: This site was variously described as  slate mine  and  slate hut or cist  on excavation maps from the 1920s (b7). The site consisted of disordered slate slabs laid on top of raised beach deposits (b5). No remains were observed at this location and it is possible that the site has been destroyed. If the site was a cist, a stone-lined box used for burial, then these features are usually of Early Bronze Age date (2000-1700 BC). However Iron Age or early medieval cists are also found (b8).--------------------------------Site history:: 1980. JOHNSON, ND / CCRA1: 1913. PENROSE WILLIAMS2: 1970. HAT / OS4: 1970. FLETCHER, MJ5: 1978. JOHNSON, ND / CCRA--------------------------------<MCO25852>: A hut on the mainland opposite Constantine Island was excavated by Penrose Williams c1912 (b4). Williams' notes suggest that the location of the hut was on the edge of an eroding cliff face. The hut was 6.5m across and completely circular with a small entrance with internal slabs and porch at the south-east, with the  walls built of slate blocks up to about 60cm high. Internally two slabs lay near the door and there was a central hearth with what appears to be a  square oven made from slate slabs and filled with reddened clay. There seem to have been no postholes and presumably the roof timbers rested on top of  the wall. The finds from the hut are listed by Williams and many are well illustrated. The finds included a piece of Glastonbury ware and other rough pottery, a piece of worked bone, some spindle whorls, a slate dagger, a human mandible, some pestles, large slates with holes, polished pebbles,  burned stones and clay, two pieces of cuttlefish, and bones of ox, sheep and  pig. There was no mention of shells even though the site is close to the sea  and is surrounded by and was overlain by a shell midden (21731.1). In addition to the domestic animal bones, rabbit bones were found outside the hut. Penrose Williams records an urn which is probably that referred to by Hencken (b6) as coming from the midden. A field survey in 2003 revealed a length of curved stone kerbing, visible in a section of eroding cliff top. The kerbing consists of two parallel arcs of flat-laid slate blocks 1.5m wide and packed with rubble. Only the top of a single course is visible. Another area of jumbled slates lies 8-9m to the east and may represent the opposite side of a roundhouse (b8). This site is likely to be one of the sites excavated or recorded in the early C20.--------------------------------Site history:1: 1913. PENROSE WILLIAMS2: 1970. HAT / OS3: 1970.

They were identified as triticum perenne and were in good order. Crawford says that the seeds were grown, but this seems improbable for Iron Age seed. It remains wholly uncertain whether the seeds were Iron Age in origin but were well preserved by the calcareous sand and  lack of light, or whether they were some sort of late introduction to an  earlier cist, implying a possible iron age burial.

10015,"HALANGY PORTH - Neolithic occupation site, Bronze Age occupation site",OCCUPATION SITE,An area of Neolithic/Bronze Age occupation near the cliff edge; no remains are now visible.,"Gray found an area of Neolithic/Bronze Age occupation near the cliff edge, where he dug four pits ('H-K' on Gray's distribution map). Pit 'H', at SV 9092 1252, (re-lettered 'A' by the OS), revealed an occupation floor of black earth with sherds, unfired clay, part fired sherds, bones, a scraper and charcoal. It lay 0.9m below the surface, was 10cm deep and was separated by 14cm of blown sand from an earlier layer containing sherds, flint cores and flakes, clay and charcoal. Pit 'I', at SV 9092 1253 (re-lettered 'B' by the OS), collapsed inward before it was completely excavated. It included a layer of stones, embedded evenly in sticky black soil or clay, together with much pottery (mostly fragments of large jars), midden materials and flints. Pit 'J', at SV 9093 1254 (re-lettered 'D' by the OS), exposed a burnt ram floor beneath 0.5m of sterile soil and 15cm of black earth containing stones and rough pottery. Sunk into the ram (periglacial head) was the lower part of a large storage jar, 32cm diameter at the base and 41cm diameter with a height of 25cm. It was weathered at the top indicating long previous exposure, and contained silt, pottery, a few pieces of charcoal and calcined bone. This pot is now reconstructed and preserved in Penzance museum. About 10cm south at a slightly higher level was the base of another pot, not in situ, similar to one from 'H'. Another 'floor' lay about 30cm east, being burnt to a depth of 3cm-6cm to a bright red colour, possibly having been used for pottery firing. Pit 'K', at SV 9093 1254 (re-lettered 'C' by the OS) consisted of a wall varying in height  from one course to 0.6m, with pottery fragments, mainly from large jars, being plentiful along its sides. There was much worked flint and some charcoal possibly indicating a hearth. The structure was not considered a dwelling but possibly a form of revetment which appeared to have been levelled after desertion; the stone was probably used at the adjacent Romano-British site (7442).

The existence of barrows is suggested by the field-names 'Burrows' and 'Burrows Moor' in the 1840 Tithe Award (b1). The only description of the group as a whole is an early C19 account in the West Briton of its destruction (b2-b4). According to this, there were fifteen barrows on the cliff top placed nearly in line, some connected by curved mounds, the largest having long been used as sea marks. Three barrows were destroyed between 1819 and 1821 (4666.08 - 4666.10) and the rest were due to be removed shortly. Two or three of the barrrows (4666.01 - 4666.02 and 4666.06) were excavated during the C19 and these may be the same ones that survive today (4666.03 - 4666.05).

The barrows are numbered sequentially (.1 to .6) from east to west. Five of the barrows (nos 2-6) are plotted on the OS 1st Ed 2500 map, but only four are still extant. The easternmost , no 1, was built over by the Admiralty during WW2, and the westernmost , no 6, was removed in 1944 in advance of an extension to quarrying, or to prevent it from slipping into the adjacent quarry (h3). The remaining four all seem to have been investigated at one time or another, but the records of these activities are far from clear. Because of the difficulty of associating a particular account with a specific barrow the excavations are described below. It is likewise difficult to associate specific finds with specific barrows and again, these are described below.Penrose Williams excavated at least one of the barrows in about 1912 with C Mott (b2). It is uncertain which one it was but from his sketches, and his description ""the one nearest to Cataclews Quarry"", it would appear that barrow 1 or 2 was the one involved. An urn was found inverted over a cremation in a small cist covered by a cairn of large stones 9.0m across and 1.6m high (b2). The mouth of the vessel seems to be that illustrated in Patchett as D8 (b6).An excavation was carried out by OGS Crawford for the Zoological Society in or before 1921 (b3). It is suggested that this involved barrow no 4. A collared urn was found in this excavation and it has been suggested that it was accompanied by a stone axe-hammer or batle-axe and a small urn or food vessel (h6). The urn, which does not seem to have been illustrated, was light yellow in colour with thin smooth sides. The axe was described as 'quartzose conglomerate'. All these finds are said to be in Truro Museum.It is reported that another excavation was carried out by a Mr Pocock at an unknown date on one of the barrows. It is possible this was the same event as the excavation by the Zoological Society above. However, a local man, Mr Hellyar from Harlyn House, suggested that it was barrow no 5 that was examined by Mr Pocock.It is also suggested that Mr Hellyar himself excavated one of the barrows before 1912. Penrose Williams included a sketch of one the vessels found in this excavation in his report on his own 1912 excavation, but there is no reason to assume that it came from the same site, as Hencken suggested. An illustration of this urn is in the Information File, and is Patchett's E12 (b6).There is also evidence for 'excavations' here before those described above. An urn was found in one of the barrows on Cataclews Point in or before 1731 (b10, but original source unknown), and some bones were found under the stones in one of the barrows before 1890 (according to W Iago in JRIC Vol 10, 185-262).

Of these, six are prominent certain prehistoric structures while the other four are mounds traced during fieldwork (h3) which appear to represent barrows. The barrow group appears to have originated in the Neolithic period and comprises a long cairn built against a natural outcrop (16087), a probable entrance grave beneath the cairn on the summit (16073.03) and a possible entrance grave on the lower north slopes (16073.04). During the Bronze Age a round barrow group was developed, most surviving examples having traces of cists or kerbs. It is probable that at this time the summit cairn was greatly enlarged and secondary cist burials were added. Most of the barrows were plundered in antiquity. The summit barrow was excavated by WC Borlase in 1879 and barrow 16073.01 was examined in 1907.

The area was used as an emergency landing ground during WW2. Following partial destruction of one of the barrows (23040.7) in 1941, Croft Andrew visited the site, excavated the disturbed barrow, and investigated seven other sites in the area. Of those, three contained archaeological material (23040.1, 23040.3, 23040.5), three proved to be natural rocky outcrops, and the last had been scraped by a mechanical digger so that no information could be retrieved. The barrows containing archaeological material were found to vary considerably in construction, and two were associated with cup-marked stones. The excavations were only published very briefly by Croft Andrew (b1); but recently P Christie has made as good an account as possible from Croft Andrew's surviving notes and other material (b2). Treligga Common was subsequently used as a bombing range (h2) causing further damage. In 1976, the OS surveyor found four of the original seven barrows to survive, none of them in particularly good condition (h2).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1976.

The name is Cornish and contains the element 'Cruc' meaning 'barrow or hillock' which may indicate the site of a barrow.  This is confirmed by the report that  five earthen jars filled with burnt bones were found at a depth of 45cm, while planting trees and shrubs in the lawn at Cotna  (24136)(b4).  Among the Truro Museum accesions for 1854 were portions of seven urns found at Cotna."

The area has now been submerged by Colliford reservoir. The group was located and surveyed by the OS in 1973 (h1) and subsequently marked on OS map (b1). Excavated in 1977-8, prior to flooding of the reservoir (site criv) (h2, b2). Nevertheless visible from the air in 1979 (p1) and depicted on the RCHM air photo plot (h3, b3). The cairns are all very close together and arranged in a north-south line over 50m along the spur. The northermost is the largest, having twice the diameter of the other two. Though it is nowhere specifically stated, the cross sections accompanying the excavation report suggest that the two smaller cairns (1784.2, 1784.3) had the appearance of simple turf-covered, possibly rimmed, platforms prior to excavation, while the larger (1784.1) may have been classifiable as a rimmed platform with central mound. Excavation showed in the case of the latter that the central mound was the earliest feature - a stone cairn constructed on the old land surface - with a turf stack revetted by a stone ring subsequently placed around it. It had no evidence of a burial. The two smaller cairns were simply stone kerb revetted turf mounds, but did have evidence for possible funerary rite. Cairn 1784.2 had a cist which had been emptied; in cairn 1784.3 a pit cut into the ground surface contained charcoal and some cremated human bone. Radio carbon dates for 1784.1 and 1784.3 suggest a Beaker/Early Bronze Age date. Pollen and soil analysis indicates that the cairns were constructed in an area of heather, bracken and grass dominated moorland, with an ironpan stagnopodzol - possibly the result of de-afforestation and increased grazing pressure. Finds consisted mainly of residual mesolithic flints (see 1786) but 1784.3 produced a pygmy cut with impressed cord decoration (b2).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1973.

Four of the cairns are marked on early OS maps (b1), and these plus one other (1411.5) were Scheduled in 1958 (h1). In 1974, the original four were re-surveyed by the OS (h2). 1411.5 was also found and surveyed; and another (1411.6) was located but not surveyed because of uncertainty about its origin. As a result, five cairns are marked on the latest OS map (b2). The RCHME aerial survey depicts the above six cairns (h4, b3) and the remaining four were discovered by Quinnell during field investigation in 1985 (h6, b4). The cairns vary in diameter from only 6.0m (1411.9) to 34m by 27m high. The majority appear to have been simple flat topped mounds, but 1411.3 and 1411.9 have dished tops which may have been an original feature; and two (1411.8, 1411.10) are tor cairns, one with a kerb and the other with a central structure, possibly a cist. The smallest and largest cairns adjoin. The majority of the cairns, particularly 1411.6 which is almost unrecognisable, have been heavily robbed, and small shelters (1421) have been built into the side of 1411.7.

Following the find of the Rillaton gold cup, the duchy's mineral agent, a Mr Colenso, was instructed to obtain details of the circumstances of the find. He wrote a letter in which he referred to three other untouched barrows adjacent to the Rillaton Barrow, which he suggested should be 'opened by trenching' (b1). As noted above, only one of these three barrows has been located. However, Quinnell observes that 40m north of Cairn PRN 1420 is a turf and whinberry covered protrusion of outcropping rock about 30m in diameter and fairly circular with a smooth rounded top, 1.5m high. It has been subjected to quarrying and stone splitting, exposing its solid rock content, but before this took place it might have been mistaken for a cairn or barrow (b2)."

They were investigated in 1740 by Stephen Williams (b6) and the site has now been built upon. Two urns were found in the outliers (20341.8, 20341.9). A road was cut through some of the barrows in the early C19, and revealed a number of ""British instruments"" (b1, b2). A map was made of this by McLaughlin (b5).<MCO440>: An urn was found in one of the barrows investigated by Williams (b1). It was found within the outer ring of stones and was under a thin slab 1.6m across. It was made of rough earth, very hard and black inside with about 8 litres of ashes inside. It was 28cm high and 23cm wide, holding about 101. It was drawn at the time by JJ Rogers and was shown with four lugs (see illustrations in SMR); some of the sherds are said to be at Truro Museum. Note that the drawings in the SMR are confined. Both the reconstructed drawings of the vessels are of one vessel, whereas the sherds are different, ie the sherds shown in relation to 54 are from this vessel; the sherd on 53 is from another vessel and the sherd shown in 135 is different again.<MCO441>: It is said that an urn was found in the demolition of one barrow in 1801, though there was no contemporary record; later records suggest that it was found in 1805 and it seems likely that it was found in one of the other barrows on Gwallen Downs, and that it was quite different from that found by Williams in 1740 (20341.10). It was classified as a late Deverel Rimbury vessel, dated after 750 BC. It was 20cm in diameter and was decorated with dots and chevrons; some remaining sherds are in Truro Museum. When found it was said to contain about 71 fragments of human bones and ashes. See note on identity of sherds, 20341.10."

(1-8) In the Portland Museum are two four-sided blocks of iron which, at opposite ends, are drawn into thick wires. These blocks of iron originally had a ticket found in the ditch at the Verne (Presumably the defensive encircling ditch). They were classified as Iron Age iron ingots of circa 100 BC by Prof. Vernon Childe (a). The Verne, Verne Hill or the Citadel are one and the same place represented by the enclosure on the hilltop.

No Bronze Age features were found inside either ring ditch; the pottery was of Middle Bronze Age date. Early Iron Age settlement was indicated by about 45 small pits and post-holes, and two ditches, probably representing land enclosure. No definite structures could be identified. The greater part of a pagan Anglo-Saxon cemetery of the late 6th or 7th century was discovered adjacent to the Bronze Age ring-ditches. The excavation revealed thirty graves, and four cremations in urns. The southern limit of the cemetery was located, and the cemetery thinned out to the west; the other limits were not located. The grave goods were consistent with a small settlement cemetery. After the cemetery went out of use, a medieval field system developed. A trench was extended a further 30 metres to the south-east from the 1978 excavations, but no additional Saxon inhumations were discovered. However, a complex of 12th/13th century gullies and ditches are consistent with the 1978 evidence of suburban development of the Bargates area. Watching briefs identified ditches on similar alignments to the west of the site",
70352,"Flagstones, Dorchester",,"A Late Iron Age settlement comprising the remains of a ditched enclosure, seven bell-shaped storage pits, both inside and outside the enclosure and three bowl-shaped pits. Significant quantities of Late Iron Age settlement debris were recovered from the enclosure ditch and some of the pits. Three pits also contained inhumation burials. The enclosure ditch and several pits were cut by a later ditch.","Late Iron Age settlement activity was concentrated in the southern end of the excavation. It comprised a ditched field system, a ditched rectangular enclosure partially within the southern part of the excavation with a number of storage pits inside and outside the enclosure. There was also a number of burials both in pits and in graves in the same area. The full extent of the settlement is not known. It certainly continued further to the east under the garden of Max Gate (2).The pottery recovered from this settlement was almost exclusively 'Durotrigian' Black-Burnished ware jars of 1st century BC/AD date, and were probably discarded cooking vessels. Other finds included worked chalk, fired clay, worked bone objects, an iron gouge, shale and stone.Snail evidence from pit [00074] indicated this pit was dug in a grassy downland environment. Charred plant remains were found in a number of pits, including wheat and barley and a range of weeds including some arable weeds and rather more grassland weeds. Sheep/goat remains predominate over cattle and horse bones, but pig was poorly represented. Dog bones and a relatively large quantity of frog/toad bones were recovered."
70353,Alington Avenue,,"<MDO18529>: Evidence for an early enclosure system was discovered during excavations at Alington Avenue in the northern and eastern parts of the main site. It comprised a number of shallow, sometimes irregular ditches and gullies. Some were stratigraphically earlier than the Early Roman D-shaped enclosure or earlier than the Early Bronze Age upper fills of the long barrow ditches.

The results of the excavations have been published as a Dorset Natural History and Archaeological Society Monograph; (DNHAS Monograph 15). The numbers in square brackets below refer to the context and feature numbers used in the published report.The Iron Age early enclosure system comprised a number of shallow, sometimes irregular ditches and gullies. Some were stratigraphically earlier than the Early Roman D-shaped enclosure or earlier than the Early Bronze Age upper fills of the long barrow ditches. They also respected the area of the Bronze Age double ring ditch suggesting that it was still extant as an earthwork and landscape feature at this time. Finds mainly consisted of flint debitage and heavily abraded early Roman pottery from the uppermost layers. Not all of the individual lengths of ditch are contemporaneous, some are cut by others but not all features can be linked into one stratigraphic sequence. The individual ditch sections do appear however, to combine to form one larger system of enclosure. Two basic phases of development of this early ditch system have been recognised. The earliest phase is composed of two main elements, a large L-shaped ditch system in the centre of the site and a smaller complex in the MW corner of the site. The major element of this first phase of boundary ditches was a long L-shaped ditch made up of several shorter sections of ditch, which presumably formed two sides of a large enclosure, though no traces of the other sides of this postulated enclosure were found. The southern side comprised of a single length of ditch [3476] which cut the south ditch [1998] of the long barrow [2000] and terminated about 16m east of the double ring-ditch [2300]. It was fairly shallow with a rounded profile and no signs of re-cutting or cleaning out. The western side of the enclosure consisted of two lengths of ditch [3666/3679] and [2457], with two causeways or entrances between them. Ditch [3666] was oriented at right angles to [3476] with an 8m gap between them. A further ditch [2660/1948] extended at right angles to the southern end of [3666] in a NE direction with a hooked terminal at the NE end. This cut the north ditch  [1999] of long barrow [2000]. In the NW corner of the site was an L-shaped ditch [3854/3895] which appears to form two sides of a square or rectangle 14m in extant length. The eastern side of this enclosure was recut by another short length of ditch [3884].Two other sections of ditch may belong to this first phase of enclosure; ditch [4008] may represent a remodelling of the corner of the large L-shaped enclosure, and ditch [1272] which ran parallel to and about 11m south of the southern side of the enclosure.The ditches of this system were allowed to silt up before an extensive remodelling took place in the digging of new ditches which largely followed the lines of the earlier ones but with a slightly altered orientation. The southern side was formed by the roughly ESE-WNE ditch [3477/3460/3474/1263] (hereafter ditch [3474]), which turned NE just 5m away from the double ring-ditch [2300] and terminated on the line of the earlier ditch [2660]. There was an 8m wide causeway or entrance at this point and then the line of the ditch was continued to the NE by ditch [3234]. The eastern end of  ditch [3474] was cut by ditch [2850/2862/2876/1288] which presumably represents a recut. It continued eastwards out of the excavated area.About 11m south of ditch [3474] was another ditch [3209/1271] which appeared to cut the earlier ditch [1272] and was traced eastwards beyond the excavated area as a geophysical anomaly running parallel to ditch [3474].Along the western side of the site, about 40m west of the enclosure was a ditch [3865] which ran parallel to ditches [3234] and [3477] and cut across the earlier L-shaped ditch [3881/3895] in the NW corner of the site. It continued southward to stop only 8m short of ditch [1600] of the double ring-ditch [2300].The overall impression is one of a system of NE-SW aligned rectilinear enclosures with a double-ditched drove running in an approximately E-W direction from the double ring-ditch along the southern boundary of the site."
70354,"Thomas Hardye School, Dorchester",,"During the summer of 1994 a series of archaeological excavations and watching briefs was undertaken by Wessex Archaeology, on behalf of Dorset County Council, West Dorset District Council and The Thomas Hardye School in the vicinity of Thomas Hardye School in the southwest outskirts of Dorchseter, Dorset. The site comprises three archaeological projects that were originally administered and organised separately. These projects were Thomas Hardye School Playing Fields (Wessex Archaeology ref: 37838), Thomas Hardye School Music Rooms (Wessex Archaeology ref: 39273) and West Dorset Leisure Centre Artificial Pitch (Wessex Archaeology ref: 38074). A total of approximately 4.5 ha was investigated. The site lies on a gentle south-facing slope below a low chalk ridge between Maiden Castle and the River Frome. The north of the site lies close to the top of the ridge at about the 87 m OD contour.Geophysical survey prior to the excavation had revealed a number of linear and circular features indicateive of Bronze Age ring ditches and early field boundaries. On excavation two main foci of prehistoric activity were revealed.The remains of a substantial Bronze Age linear barrow cemetery were also recorded. These comprised five barrows of which four had surviving mound deposits. The barrows and their ditches contained burials, both cremations and inhumations, indicative of a prolonged period of use and development of the barrow cemetery. Finds, particularly the large quantities of worked flint, also suggested non-ritual use of the barrows. These barrows were significant monuments in their own right and the probably also formed part of an impressive barrow cemetery ranged along a chalk ridge to the east, including Fordington Farm barrow, Conquer Barrow and the barrow central to the Flagstones enclosure.After partial excavation of the barrows, a scheme for their preservation in situ was proposed and implemented which entailed their consolidation prior to reburial beneath up to 21.5 m of chalk.",

70375,Gussage All Saints,,,"Iron Age settlement and enclosure, listed by RCHME as Gussage All Saints 20, and initially identified by air photography. The site was totally excavated in 1972, partly due to the erosion being caused by ploughing but primarily to review the evidence for Iron Age settlement provided by Bersu's 1938-9 excavation of Little Woodbury. The site was occupied throughout the second half of the 1st millennium BC and into the early decades of the Roman period. The enclosure ditch, irregular and asymmetrical, measured 120 metres north-south and 100 metres east-west internally. There appears to have been an external bank. The main entrance was to the east, and featured timber structures and was approached by ""antennae"" ditches which presented a funnel-like approach to the enclosure. Three main phases of occupation were identified. During the third phase, the ditch seems not to have been maintained as a physical barrier. Occupation in the first phase was represented largely by pits, post holes and some four-post structures. No round houses were identified. In the second phase, the pits and postholes were accompanied by one definite and one possible round house. The third phase saw the construction of several smaller enclosed areas, some of which may have contained timber buildings, though no clear patterning was visible among postholes and other features. The site produced a considerable assemblage of pottery from all 3 phases. Bronze and iron working occurred in all phases. An iron furnace belonging to the early Roman period was found. The most notable metalwork deposit however was from a single pit close to the site's main entrance, and dating to the 1st century BC. It comprised a large assemblage of mould and metalworking debris arising from the production of harness and chariot fittings. Remains of over 50 individuals were found, mostly from the last phase. An inhumation in a wooden coffin found just outside the main entrance was dated by pottery to the 3rd century AD."

The form of the earthworks and very limited excavation in 1958 suggest that the fort was being re-built in its later stages, and that this work was not completed. The north-eastern part of the ramparts was disturbed by construction of a railway cutting in 1857. This exposed the filling of the ditch, within which was what was interpreted as a mass grave. At least 80 skeletons were removed on this occasion, and the following year at least 40 more were removed from somewhere in the vicinity, though their exact location was not recorded.

(2)Only the extension of the main settlement was excavated. The coin distributions on the ground made it almost certain that themain centre of occupation was in an arable field directly to the south of the excavated area of the dyke, ie the crossing of Bokerley Dyke and the Roman Road. This field has not been excavated.There was a thin scatter of coarse IA pottery but coins indicated that serious settlement did not take place before AD 275; of a total of 1200 coins only 18 were from Trajan to Severus Alexander.Of the area excavated the main plan consisted of a drainage system which formed rectilinear enclosures. At 'A' (SU 03061998)a corn-drying furnace was found and in the vicinity eleven pits and hearths. There were numerous burials, mostly extended inhumations in later Roman manner but at 'B' (SU 03291997) a pit contained a contracted skeleton in native or early Roman style. It had a Claudian brooch against its hip. At 'C' (SU 03231999) was a cremation in a dug-out coffin. Five inhumations were in a rectangular ditched cemetery.The site grew essentially as a Roman road-side settlement. It may be Vindogladia but if so there is a discrepancy of 20 milesin the distance from Sarum to Dorchester in the Antonine Itinerary. Mr G H Wheeler believes Vindogladia to be at BadburyRings (a). By circa AD 325 it had become more than a simple roadside settlement and had busy and populous occupation. (3)The area was partly under the plough and partly under grass. There were no surface finds or other indications of settlement. (4)No further information and nothing surveyable in Hants. (5)Excavations carried out in 1958 before the widening of the Blandford-Salisbury Road at Bokerly Corner. These served to reinforce the findings of Pitt-Rivers. Pits, hearths, ditches a corn drying oven, and a skeleton associated with pottery and coins, mainly Constantinian, were uncovered. A bronze statuette and 19 coins, of which only one was post-370 date, were also found.

The site lies on either side of Bokerley Dyke, around the point known as Bokerley Junction, where the Roman road from Old Sarum to Dorchester passes through the dyke.Apart from a little Iron Age pottery, a burial with a brooch of the 1st century A.D., and some sherds and coins of the 1stand 2nd centuries, all the finds indicate occupation from about 275-400. Their distribution suggests that the most intensiveactivity was W. of the Roman road and S. of Bokerley Dyke. and the large number of coins (over 1,200), mostly of the 4thcentury, may suggest a market or a shrine. To the N. of the dyke several roughly rectangular enclosures were formed by ditches10 ft. wide and 2 ft. to 5 ft. deep. Among them were eleven pits, hearths, a corn-drying oven and 'occasional' burials. Aninhumation cemetery with burials orientated E.-W., perhaps Christian, occupied a square enclosure 112 ft. by 120 ft., with adtich 6 ft. wide and 3 ft. deep. The roughly rectangular enclosures may have extended further W. and E.To the S. were fifteen similar pits, ditches, hearths, another oven, and a burial. A bronze figurine of Venus was found on theedge of Bokerley Dyke (16). At this point the dyke was cut through occupation debris in c.A.D. 330, extended through thesettlement in 367, and was realigned after 393. Finds are in Farnham Museum in D.C.M. and in B.M.

70391,"Sewerby Cottage Farm, Bridlington",,"<Description on On-Site Archaeology website>: During the late Iron Age much of the development area was enclosed by land boundaries, revealed throughout the evaluation and excavation programmes. In the northern excavations a square barrow and round barrow were also constructed at this time. The square barrow contained a late Iron Age inhumation and was furnished with an iron dagger and missile head. A rural farming settlement built up around the land boundaries and barrows and occupation continued until the end of the second century AD. The settlement was based around arable cultivation and livestock. Three crop driers were used between the first and second centuries AD and in the north of the site there was evidence for a system of fence-lines and droveways related to livestock management.",
70392,"South Lawn, Melton",,"<On-Site Archaeology website summary>: The archaeological potential of the site was already known before work began on the road improvements. The lines of ditches buried beneath the crop in the arable field at South Lawn had been spotted on an aerial photograph, taken in 1976. This showed that the area north of the A63 was crossed by ditches running east to west in parallel with the modern road. They seemed to run along the side of an ancient and long forgotten trackway. This was crossed by other ditches running north to south. The layout of the ditches looked very much like other sites from the region, which are known as ladder settlements and date from the late Iron Age or early Roman period (c. 150 BC to c. 300 AD). Sites like these are important as they span the period of the Roman conquest and can tell us how the Roman occupation may have affected the lives of the people who already lived here. At Melton we had the rare opportunity to investigate the remains of a ladder settlement on a large scale. This confirmed that the site was occupied between about 100 BC and 300 AD. It also showed that the ladder settlement originated much earlier than expected. Furthermore, some elements, such as the trackway, survived for centuries, after the Roman period, until at least the seventh century AD.",

70396,"Tankerness, Mine Howe",,,"HY50NW 38 5105 0603This is one of many glacial-looking hillocks lying E of the cemetery and 400m SE of the parish hall at Toab. A good few years before 1979 a school-teacher moved some stone on the summit and found an opening with steps leading down. The proprietor caused the opening to be re-sealed.RCAHMS 1987, visited April 1979.An underground chamber relating to the mound was rediscovered in 1999. An excavation was undertaken and the mound, though natural, contained a chamber and was surrounded by a ditch. For a full account, see MS/1040/3.NMRS MS/1043/1This subterranean structure has been sunk into a natural mound in an area of undulating ground about 100m SE of the cemetery on Churchyard Road, Tankerness. The mound itself, which is indistinguishable from other natural mounds in the vicinity, is about 3m in height, and it formerly lay at the centre of an oval ditched enclosure measuring some 41m from N to S by 37m transversely internally, with a broad entrance facing towards the W (Card et al. 2000 (NMRS MS 1040/3), GSB 1999 (NMRS MS 2000/1)). No trace of the ditch is now visible, but the mound occupies the whole of the interior, and the ground rises gradually from roughly the line of its inner lip to the summit where a modern pit has been sunk and now provides access to the mouth of the structure below. Built of drystone masonry, the latter lies beneath the centre of the mound and comprises two flights of stone steps, the upper of which leads down to a half-landing and the entrances to two subsidiary galleries, and the lower on down to a corbelled chamber at the bottom.The structure appears to have been constructed in a pit about 4.4m in diameter, and the floor of the corbelled chamber at the bottom lies 7.4m below the top of the mound. The pit in the summit, which now contains metal stairs, has been dug down 1.85m, revealing that the material above the structure is composed of unconsolidated earth and stone, perhaps largely derived from midden. The upper flight, comprising seventeen ladder-like steps, drops down from N to S between coursed drystone walls for a further 2.75m to the half-landing on to which the two subsidiary galleries open. The S wall of the half-landing is formed by natural till, and presumably forms the S side of the pit in which the structure is built. The entrance to the lower gallery is about 0.6m square and its sill is 0.43m above the half-landing; the gallery itself is no more than 0.4m in width at one point and it extends back in a shallow arc for about 2.4m. The upper gallery, the sill of its entrance 1.42m above the half-landing, runs back above the roof of the lower flight of steps and the corbelled chamber; some 2.8m in length, it is much wider and higher than the lower gallery, measuring up to 0.9m in width and 1.25m in height at its inner end. Midden deposits are visible on the N side where the masonry at the inner end has collapsed. The capstones of the roof above the ladder steps is about 2.7m above the half-landing, but two other lintels span the void, acting as tie-beams between the walls flanking the steps. This structural technique relieves the dead-weight of the masonry above the structure, and, whatever other functions the galleries may have fulfilled, they too serve this purpose.From the half-landing the stair turns back on itself, descending a further 1.9m in a flight of eleven steps to a sill 0.9m above the floor of the corbelled chamber. The latter is about 1.3m in diameter and the capstones of its roof are 4.1m above the floor. The drop down from the lowest step gives the chamber a cistern-like appearance, and the fissures between two massive sandstone slabs forming the floor, which are probably bedrock, are filled with clay. The chamber does not hold water at present, but the present water table may be below the level of its floor.It is noteworthy that the top flight of steps is oriented to face N, minimising the ingress of light into the structure. The drystone wall construction, the ladder-like steps and the various techniques for relieving the dead-weight of the structure, suggest an Iron Age date, and this is supported by evidence from the recent excavations (Card et al. 2000). The 'well' inside the Broch of Gurness (HY32NE 5; Fojut 2001) provides a good analogy and other parallels are listed by Hedges (1987).Visited by RCAHMS (DCC) 19 November 1999N Fojut 2001; JW Hedges 1987 ; GSB, 1999 (NMRS MS 2000/1); N Card, J Downes and J Gibson 2000 (NMRS MS 1040/3)HY 5105 0603 In the late summer of 1999, local farmer Douglas Paterson rediscovered an underground structure which had originally been found in 1946. Since its initial discovery the site had almost been forgotten apart from a brief mention in the SMR.The chamber comprises a series of steps that descend to an intermediary landing that has two side chambers off to one side. A further flight of steps lead down to a chamber c 1.5m in diameter with a corbelled stone roof rising to c 4m above the flagged stone floor. The floor of this chamber is c 7m below the top of the glacial moraine into which it was built. Most of the structure is lined with drystone masonry. The Royal Commission surveyed the site in November 1999, resulting in a plan, a section through the chamber, and a contour survey (see this volume, p 106).GSB Prospection was commissioned to do a geophysical survey, utilising magnetometry, resistivity and ground-probing radar (GPR). The results of this showed that a large ditch, c 7m wide, 50m in diameter, and with a clear break/entrance on the NW side, surrounded the mound. Concentric to this ditch was a series of what appeared to be subsidiary gullies and ditches at intermittent points around the mound. Evidence for settlement-type activity occurred both in and around the entrance across the main ditch. GPR indicated the possibility of other chambers existing within the mound.Due to a series of agricultural threats, the uniqueness of the structure, and the need for a better understanding of the site prior to Scheduling, excavation was started in the early summer of 2000. The main aims of the project were to evaluate the nature and date of the features revealed by geophysics and to look at the relationships between these various elements and the underground chamber. Four main trenches were opened.Trench A was located across the main ditch opposite the entrance to look at the relationship of this ditch to two of the subsidiary outer gullies/ditches. Excavation revealed that the ditch here was c 5m wide by 2.5m deep with a sharp U-shaped profile. The ditch had been deliberately infilled with a series of midden and rubble fills that probably represent several different phases. Finds from these fills include Roman glass, a fibula brooch and Middle to Late Iron Age pottery. Within, and probably contemporary with the ditch was a paved area, c 2m wide, which may have extended around the mound. This paving was set on a platform cut into the mound and had a revetting wall along the back of it against the mound. Once the ditch had been infilled the paving was extended to partially cover the ditch. In an extension to this trench, to the SW, the paving and revetting had been extended to form a semi-circular platform/'alcove' cut into the mound. The gullies suggested by geophysics outside the main ditch proved to be illusory. These features were created by a series of anthropogenic soils built up against the sides of the mound. A 1m wide slit trench was extended from the NW end of this trench up to the opening of the underground chamber, to examine the relationship of the ditch to the chamber and to determine the presence of any structure on top of the mound. Glacial boulder clay was encountered directly under the topsoil. This may have been partially redeposited to enhance the height of the mound, but concerns over destabilising the underground structure prevented further investigation.Trench B was located over one of the main ditch terminals. This revealed a ditch up to 7m wide and 4m deep with a flat-bottomed U-shaped profile. The earlier phases of the ditch were associated with at least three different phases of revetting of the terminal. The later phases of revetting included a widening of the entrance causeway and a partial infilling of the ditch with rubble. The upper ditch fills contained much more midden material. This contained a large element of metalworking debris which probably originated from some ephemeral structures at the NW end of this trench and those uncovered in Trench E. Latterly these midden deposits were partially paved over before the ditch was totally infilled. As in Trench A, a 1m wide slit trench was extended from the SE end of the trench over the mound towards the present entrance to the underground chamber. This revealed a shallow linear feature and the edge of a small cist-like structure. This trench was further extended to totally uncover the cist, which was filled with a dark, charcoal-rich fill and a small amount of cremated bone.Trench C was located over two anomalies revealed by geophysics; an apparent circular enclosure cut by or cutting one of the subsidiary gullies/ditches. On excavation neither feature was detected. Instead, 1m of anthropogenic midden-rich soils overlay a series of gleyed clay deposits over 1m thick. The interpretation of these deposits awaits the analysis of soil samples.Trench E was located over the apparent settlement area outside of the causeway across the main ditch. Under a series of rubble and midden spreads a lobate Late Iron Age structure was uncovered in association with some very ephemeral features. This structure overlay an earlier, larger structure, probably a roundhouse. These structures were separated from midden-enriched soils to the N by the remains of a field boundary stone dyke. Middens associated with these structures produced a large range of industrial waste including moulds, slag, furnace linings and evidence for bone and antler working. In the SE corner of the trench a section of bank was revealed composed of redeposited natural. This may be an external bank to the main ditch that surrounds the mound.Trench F was dug by machine in an area identified as being clear of archaeology and was intended for the disposal of the waste from the chemical toilet. However, at a depth of c 1.3m beneath a series of anthropogenic soils, a deposit of cremated bone and charcoal was revealed. It is at present not clear whether the bone is human or if the horizon in which it was found is a soil or deposit. Under this were clay deposits similar to those at the bottom of Trench C.Although the underground structure had been extensively emptied in 1946, in situ deposits were identified in the middle chamber. This ashy midden was sampled and was also found to contain both native Iron Age pottery and a sherd of coarse Roman ware.Sponsors: Historic Scotland, Orkney Islands Council, Orkney Enterprise, Orkney College, Time Team, Orkney Archaeological Trust.N Card, J Downes and J Gibson 2000HY 510 060 The Late Iron Age metalworking area outwith the ditch that surrounds the underground structure at Mine Howe (HY50NW 38; DES 2001, 71) was further investigated in 2002. Further evidence recovered includes crucibles, slag, tuyeres, furnace linings and a kiln. This appeared to be associated with an oval stone structure c 6m in diameter. A whale-tooth sword pommel was recovered in one of the alcoves built into the wall of this structure. Time did not allow the floor deposits of this structure to be investigated. Several sherds of Romano-British colour-coated ware were also recovered.Archive to be deposited in Orkney SMR and the NMRS.Sponsors: HS, Orkney Islands Council, Orkney Archaeology Trust, Orkney College, University of SheffieldN Card and J Downes 2002HY 510 060 The Late Iron Age metalworking area (Trench E), outwith the ditch that surrounds the underground structure, was further investigated in 2003 (HY50NW 38; see DES 2002, 87-8). Excavation concentrated on the round structure uncovered at the end of the 2002 season. Four main phases of activity within this structure have so far been identified. Throughout its history it appears to have been primarily a workshop for the production of non-ferrous metalwork. Besides a wide assemblage of associated debris being recovered (including moulds, crucibles, a steatite ingot mould, a copper ingot, anvils and whetstones), several small kilns were found in the interior.This workshop may only represent the last phase in a long history of metalworking at Mine Howe. A deep sondage was excavated to the N of the workshop to further explore the plaggen soils around the site. This revealed that over 2m of archaeological material had been deliberately deposited during the Iron Age. Near the base of this sondage, ironworking debris was still encountered. The sondage also showed that the landscape around Mine Howe had been dramatically altered during the life of the underground structure.A new trench (Trench G) was located over the main ditch to the W of the underground chamber. Unlike Trenches A and B opened in 2000 (DES 2000, 65-6), this trench was intended to investigate a 'quiet' area of the ditch as suggested by the magnetometry survey. Excavation, however, showed that the lack of magnetic responses in this area was due to the depth of overburden masking underlying features. An extensive spread of animal bone was encountered in the upper fills - corresponding to a similar bone spread in the ditch terminal excavated in 2000. Below this were thick deposits of ashy middens - again similar episodes of deposition were encountered in previously excavated ditch sections. Beneath the middens, part of an oval stone-built structure, c 3.5m in diameter, was uncovered. The single-faced walling of this structure consisted partly of upright slabs with drystone masonry on top and was built into the partially infilled ditch. The floor was partially flagged with rough paving, slumping into the underlying ditch fills. A possible drain underlay the paving. No finds were associated with this structure.After the ditch had become totally infilled and was probably no longer visible, a sub-circular pit, c 1.5m in diameter by 0.5m deep, was dug into the outer edge of the ditch. This was lined by a series of large upright slabs. In the uppermost fill, central to the pit, was the inhumation of a child. Apart from a spread of charcoal lower down, the rest of this feature was devoid of finds.A narrow slot trench was extended from the NE corner of Trench G towards the top of the mound, in order to investigate a small, discrete, highly magnetic anomaly. This was only one of numerous similar anomalies that appeared in the original magnetometry survey. This anomaly proved to be a largely intact iron furnace. It had been built in a shallow pit with four upright, carefully wedged slabs forming the main structure, c 0.45m square. The fired clay superstructure had collapsed into the interior which was filled with slag. Two small upright stones on one side probably formed a flue or access point for a tuyre. This furnace was left unexcavated and covered over. It is hoped that a metallurgist specialist will be involved in the dismantling of this next year. A single course of revetment was revealed in this trench on the inner edge of the main ditch - similar to that found in Trench A in 2000.Report to be lodged with Orkney SMR and the NMRS.Sponsors: HS, Orkney Islands Council, Orkney Enterprise, Orkney Archaeology Trust, Orkney College.N Card, J Downes 2003HY 510 060 Excavations in 2004 were aimed at elucidating the nature and range of activities that took place subsequent to the construction of the underground chamber and its surrounding ditch (see DES 2003, 101-2). The Iron Age metalworking area (Trench E), which lies outwith the ditch that surrounds the underground structure, was further investigated.Excavation concentrated on the smithy uncovered at the end of the 2002 season (DES 2002, 87-8), with preliminary investigation of the floor levels in 2003. Evidence for both ferrous and non-ferrous metalwork was found. In the primary phase of use, a large central hearth was surrounded by evidence for various associated activities including small smithing furnaces, anvils, etc. A very rich assemblage of associated metalworking debris was also recovered. Archaeomagnetic dating of the central hearth provided a date of 100 BC to AD 110. At the end of the primary phase of use, a formalised extended inhumation burial of a young woman was placed under the floor of the smithy. She was buried with a toe ring on each foot and an antler object on her chest.In 2003, a deep sondage excavated to the N of the smithy revealed that over 2m of archaeological material had been deliberately deposited during the Iron Age and that the landscape around Mine Howe had been dramatically altered during the Iron Age. This sondage was extended in 2004. This revealed that outwith the inner ditch surrounding the mound containing the underground chamber there had been an outer gully, probably natural, c 40m wide and up to 2m deep. Although present at the front of the monument, the extent of this feature is not clear.The structure revealed within the ditch in Trench G in 2003 was fully excavated and removed. Below this were further ditch fills and, as in the ditch terminal, several phases of revetting. The overall depth of the ditch in this trench was over 4m. The furnace uncovered in 2003 on the side of the mound was also further investigated.As part of the study of the environs of Mine Howe, the Bronze Age barrow on the top of the neighbouring glacial moraine of Long Howe was investigated. Although the central cist had been emptied in the past, a beautifully constructed kerb cairn was revealed. Within the cairn make-up several Mesolithic microlithsand general flint knapping debitage were recovered. These artefacts may be associated with several sub-circular features downslope from the cairn as revealed by geophysics.Three areas were investigated by geophysical techniques. Resistance survey was carried out to the NE of the current excavations, extending the survey originally undertaken in 1999. The results show a well-defined zone of high resistance, which coincides with a slight topographic rise. Although the data suggests the presence of stone structures/rubble, no clearly defined structural elements are discernible.Detailed gradiometer and resistance survey were undertaken on Long Howe. The survey aimed to refine the gradiometer data collected during a previous survey (DES 2000, 65-6) by using finer sampling intervals and more sensitive equipment. The survey added some detail to the previous survey, suggesting clearly defined coherent anomalies of likely archaeological origin.Gradiometer survey was also undertaken in the field to the W of St Ninian's Chapel and located numerous anomalies. While some are clearly agricultural in origin, a concentration of pit-type anomalies in the W of the field may be archaeologically significant. There is some evidence in the data to suggest a possible stone structure, although further survey is needed to clarify the nature of this group of anomalies.Report to be lodged with Orkney SMR and the NMRS.Sponsors: HS, Orkney Islands Council; Orkney Enterprise; Orkney Archaeological Trust; Orkney College; University of Bradford.N Card, J Downes and S Ovenden 2004Excavation; geophysical survey HY 510 060 Excavations in August 2005 were aimed at further elucidating the nature and range of activities that took place after the construction of the underground chamber and its surrounding ditch (DES 2004, 96-7). The Iron Age metalworking area (Trench E), which lay outwith the ditch that surrounded the undergroundstructure, was further investigated. Excavation concentrated on the round structure uncovered at the end of the 2002 season, with preliminary investigation of the floor levels in 2003 and 2004. Throughout its history it appears to have been primarily a smithy for the production of both ferrous and non-ferrous metalwork.

A very rich assemblage of associated metalworking debris has been recovered. Archaeomagnetic dating of the central hearthprovided a date of 100 BC - AD 110.In addition to the burial discovered within the floor deposits of the smithy in 2004, a second burial was discovered just outwith the smithy: an adult male lying on his side in a semi-crouched position in a shallow pit.The ditch section in Trench G was fully excavated to reveal a complete cross-section of the ditch, which was over 4m deep and 8.5m wide. A sequence of ditch infilling and remodelling was uncovered, similar to that found in the ditch terminal (Trench B in 2000).Further geophysical anomalies on the S side of the central mound were also investigated. Overall these proved to be natural, however evidence for the enhancement of the mound was revealed along with a small paved 'alcove'.Several small discrete magnetic anomalies, with similar signatures to the one that represented a furnace revealed in 2003-4, were also investigated. These turned out to be the result of modern ferrous debris.In 2004, as part of the study of the environs of Mine Howe, the Bronze Age barrow on the top of the neighbouring glacial moraine of Long Howe was investigated. Within the cairn make-up several Mesolithic microliths and general flint-knapping debitage were recovered. It was thought that these lithics could be associated with several sub-circular features downslope from the cairn, as revealed by geophysics. Extensive trial trenching over these anomaliesshowed that they were natural and, apart from some further lithics, no trace of any in situ Mesolithic activity was recovered.Report to be lodged with Orkney SMR and NMRS.Sponsors: HS A, Orkney Islands Council, Orkney Archaeology Trust, Orkney College, University of Bradford.N Card, J Downes and S Ovenden 2005.Surveys were carried out as the fieldwork component of the Geophysical Survey module for the MA in Archaeological Practice at Orkney College. Three areas were investigated around Mine Howe.Area 1 - Detailed gradiometer and resistance survey were undertaken on Long Howe. The survey aimed to refine the gradiometer data collected during a previous survey (GSB 2000) by using finer sampling intervals and more sensitive equipment and by comparing gradiometer and resistance data. This survey added some detail to the previous survey (GSG 2000) suggesting clearly defined coherent anomalies of likely archaeological origin.Area 2 - Gradiometry was carried out in the field to the west of St Ninian's Chapel, as a continuation of survey undertaken by GSB Prospection Ltd (GSB 2001). In this instance only gradiometry was undertaken and data collected at the standard 1m by 0.25m interval. A variety of anomalies were identified. While some are clearly argricultural in origin, a concentration of pit type anomalies in the west of the field may be archaeologically significant. There is some evidence in the data to suggest a possible stone structure, although further survey is needed to clarify the nature of this group of anomalies.Area 3 - Resistance survey was carried out to the northeast of the current excavations at Mine Howe, extending the survey originally undertaken by GSB Prospection (GSB 1999). This survey shows a well-defined zone of high resistance, which coincides with a slight topographic rise. Although the data suggests the presence of stone structures/rubble no clearly defined structural elements are discernable in the data.Information from S M Ovenden, 18 March 2005."

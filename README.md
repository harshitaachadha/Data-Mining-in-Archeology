# Data-Mining-in-Archeology 

**Research Conducted for CSCI-6443 Term Paper**

The objective of this term paper is to explore the impact of data mining techniques in archeological research enhancement. To this effect, a detailed study of the various techniques and latest research presentations that utilize data mining to derive previously unknown insights from archeological data will be undertaken. Information about the data sources themselves and their curation will also be presented. Moreover, to demonstrate the applicability of data mining in the field of archeology, three case studies will also be presented. 

The first case study will utilize the Beazley Archive Pottery Database (BAPD) and the data mining technique of Temporal Trend Analysis of Pottery Styles. The BAPD data set is the world’s largest digital information collection about ancient Greek pottery. The information in the dataset will be analyzed to understand the evolution of trends in pottery design over time and what might these trends indicate in terms of cultural and sociopolitical shifts within the society of ancient Greece itself.  

The second case study will utilize the Southern African Radiocarbon Dating Database (SARD) as maintained by the Oxford Radiocarbon Accelerator Unit at the University of Oxford. The database will be utilized to apply clustering analysis on ancient sites and biomes with the goal of investigating how different biomes influenced the sites and their functions in ancient Africa. 

The third case study utilizes the Digital Archive for Grave Goods: Objects and Death in Later Prehistoric Britain as maintained by the UK’s Archeology Data Service. The Prehistoric Grave Goods project database contains information on grave artifacts from the Neolithic, Bronze Age, and Iron Age. The objective is to use the dataset to explore relationships amongst the burial site attributes, the grave goods, and the nature of the remains by using association rule mining with an aim to identify the significance of specific goods occurrences within distinct cultural contexts and time periods resulting in a holistic view of burial practices in older civilizations.

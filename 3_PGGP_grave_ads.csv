The grave was placed within a square-ditched enclosure, the ditches of which probably created the spoil for a low barrow mound covering the burial. The body was contained within a rectangular decayed container (probably a wooden coffin). A small charcoal-rich pit with a small amount of unidentified burnt bone in the fill was cut into the upper grave fill and could represent a further pre-mound burial. Given the inconclusive nature of the evidence this is not recorded as an additional burial here.The main grave goods included a badly corroded sword (with three suspension rings and an oak scabbard with a decorated mouth guard), aligned along the right side of the body with the hilt at his/her shoulder and the tip towards the feet; a spear (of which only the spearhead and fragments of mineralised wood from the socket survived), thrust diagonally across the body into the south-east wall of the grave; and a Gallo-Belgic butt-beaker, placed tidily at the north-east corner of the grave, outside container. The latter was associated with an area of 'decayed organic material' probably a food offering. Fragments of an East Sussex eyebrow pot found within the grave fill were not convincing as grave goods (Stevenson 2013, 152-8).

It had been set just above the old ground surface upon some large flints which were above a deposit of sand. Around and above the urn were pieces of charcoal ... The urn had evidently been set in a cavity in the dark grey sand and gravel stones (Layer 3) which material appears to have been the first to have been heaped up.Immediately beneath the urn, and coinciding with the cavity in which the urn and its packing had been set, was an infilled pit. This pit (Fig. 4) was ovate in plan with a shallow attached lobe. The infilling was sand and darker, slightly loamy, material, which fell readily away from the hard, apparently unweathered, sides. It was not possible to define the pit bottom with any certainty, on account of roots. However, it would seem to have been baggy and irregular. Alder charcoal fragments were recovered from the infilling of the lobe, while the adjacent pit side was reddened, sintered and charcoal-flecked, as if burned. The pit bottom and other sides were unmarked.Potential pyre material comprising 'packed pine and oak charcoal and fire-marked flints' was deposited in a nearby pit.The excavator suggests that the fire in the pit below the cremation urn represents a separate burning episode (alder was the main species represented in the charcoal sample in contrast to mainly pine in the sample from the nearby poss. pyre debris pit (ibid., 150). The charcoal report comments on the likely absence of pine wood in the immediate vicinity of the site.

In addition to the sword, which survived within a bronze scabbard, the grave goods included a mirror, shield fittings, a sword belt ring, a brooch and a spiral ring (all of copper alloy), together with a shattered tin object. There was also evidence for the grave having contained a sheepskin or fleece and woven textile incorporating goat and other animal hairs.The sword, when found by Paul Jenkins, was lying along the western side of the cist with its hilt to the north. He noted that the sword was lying in the surface deposits of the grave and it is perhaps surprising that it was not more deeply embedded in the washed-in luting (as were the skeletal remains and the other artefacts). The scabbard had been placed face down in the grave with the suspension loop uppermost, causing fragmentation of the embedded front scabbard plate when the sword was pulled out of the grave.The mirror was found on the west side at the north end of the cist, lying 100mm from the skull impression, with its handle uppermost and angled towards the north west. The reflective surface would have been turnedtowards the face of the deceased person. The sword belt ring was located 50mm south-west of the bottom of the mirror. The spiral ring and tin object were below the mirror, and were lifted in the same soil block. The brooch was recovered from near the probable position of the feet of the inhumation.The shield fittings were only identified after the excavation. The four knobs, presumably from the corners of the shield, were quite closely grouped and spaced equidistantly in the lower, central part of thegrave. The position of the fittings suggests that the Bryher shield was probably broken or folded transversely and propped up against the west wall of the cist ...

This was irreparably broken by the pressure of large pieces of chalk but, judging from the fragments, its type was quite different from the one from grave B.

About 2 inches to the west of this article was a small lump of black matter resembling burnt wood, but apparently the residue of some other substance; and near it traces of more dark matter were observed. Slightly below the flint were portions of a decayed beaver's front tooth (fig. 340), while close by was a very fine knife of black flint (fig. 341) 2 1/2 inches long and nearly 1 inch broad, flat on one side and ridged on the other by chipping, having also the ends rounded by a similar process.

It contained a deposit of 292 g of cremated human bone [probably actually 11g - see human remains record for an explanation]. The cremated remains were probably originally contained within [a bowl] (Morris 2006, fig. 12 no. 65).

A set of metal tools - an iron knife, a small iron blade, four iron awls and a copper alloy ring headed pin - were probably also contained within the bowl (Fig. 101; Fell, Keys and Shaffrey 2006). These tools appeared to have been burnt (perhaps at the same time as the human remains) since they were covered with haematite. Four fragments of burnt antler found amongst the cremated remains may be the remains of the knife handle. A small sandstone whetstone was associated with these tools.

60025,72324,Primary,1,,Cist,Unknown,"<Barber et al 1996, Bu Farm>: The basal slab [of the cist] did not rest directly upon the buried natural ground surface, but on a spread of dark soil (F406, F407) that included charcoal and burnt bone fragments. Some of this material (F407) may have been intruded from the cist at the point where the basal slab was broken through but it was also possible to identify undisturbed material (F406) which had clearly been deposited before the construction of the cist. Material from this context was submitted for radiocarbon dating and returned a determination  of 2955 ± 85 BP  (AA-11766).Mammal, bird and fish bones were represented  in the deposit which underlay  the cist (F406). The mammal remains included sheep (Ovis aries), dog/fox (Canis sp/ Vulpes vulpes), and common vole (Microtus arvalis). It should be noted that  immature  dog and fox bones  are morphologically very similar and, in the case of a single bone, it is difficult to draw a definite conclusion about the species present. The bird remains included red grouse (Lagopus scoticus), teal (Anas crecca), kitti  wake (Rissa tridactyla), guillemot (Uria aalge), snipe (Gallinago gallinago ), gannet (Sula bassana) and greylag goose (Anser anser). Fish was represented by a single cod (Gadus morhua) premaxilla.O'Sullivan in Barber et al 1996 notes that: this material may represent either creatures that used the cairn for nesting or remains which were deposited in the cairn by predators and carrion-eaters. This explanation may account for the wide range of faunal remains from the disturbed, partly vacuous body of the cairn, but is less likely to be true of the sheep, vole, dog/fox and wildfowl bones which were sealed by the central cist. These - with the possible exception of the rodent bones - may have been deliberately deposited prior to construction of the cist. This could be asserted with more confidence if the bones were burnt. However, as this is not the case, the possibility  that these bones  are also intrusive cannot be dismissed and their significance remains unresolved.",1,1,,Assemblage,Cremation

The grave measured 1.30 by 1.05m was cut with steep, near vertical sides and flat base to a depth of 0.56m. Five struck flint flakes, animal bones and a cockle shell were recovered from the grave fill. Responding to the reverse stratigraphy represented by c14 dates (the earliest date comes from the upper burial), the excavator suggests that an initial burial (possibly Sk 566) with a Food Vessel was disturbed/removed by the insertion of the later interment (Sk 623).Sk 623:hr: The primary burial (SK 623) was of a child aged approximately five years laid on its right side, head to the north-west, facing south-west, with legs tightly flexed. The left arm was laid parallel with the body, with the forearm flexed and across the waist. The right upper arm lay parallel with the front of the body. Bone from the child provided a radiocarbon date of 1520-1280 cal BC (lab no 130971)Sk 566:hr: Over the pelvis of the child but separated from the early burial by a layer of soil was the fragmentary remains of the skull of a neonate, no more than a month old (SK 566). A few fragments of bone recovered from the upper grave fill by sieving were also from the burial, which was in a badly decomposed state. Bone from the skull of the later burial provided a radiocarbon date of 1955-1670 cal BC (lab no 141268)gg: At the foot of the grave (northeast end), and lying above the base of the grave in grave fill capping the skeleton, was the broken but nearly complete remains of a small undecorated Food Vessel - an open handled bowl of early to middle Bronze Age date.The Food Vessel is given an indirect relationship with the bodies here.",1,2,,Pot [Food Vessel],"Inhumation, Inhumation"

The head of the skeleton was at the northern end, which had been disturbed by animals. The grave cut across the gully next to the path of the (by then) demolished building complex, and was partly sealed by stone spread.The skeleton was an adult female between 36-45 years old, lying flexed on her right side and facing east with legs bent at right angles to the spine and arms tucked against the chest with the left hand over the jaw and the right hand next to the face. Examination of the bones revealed evidence of a possible poor diet and anaemia, osteoarthritis, dental caries and plaque.Three complete pottery vessels accompanied this burial, all placed near the head.  The vessel forms are comparable with the late 1st century BC Ôwar cemeteryÕ assemblage found at Maiden Castle, and two of the pots had distinct vertical ribs.

These remains were placed in a grave large enough to contain a crouched inhumation, and were accompanied by the objects noted below. The grave was first filled with turf, over which was piled clean chalk, presumably derived from the excavation of the grave. A tumulus, 62 feet in diameter, composed of turf with a chalk capping, was raised over the grave, and a ditch 5 feet wide and 100 feet in external diameter, the source of the chalk for the capping, surrounded it. The burial was accompanied by a three-riveted, grooved-and-dotted ogival bronze dagger and a large perforated whetstone, the former still retaining on its underside part of its leather sheath. Also in the grave were a now incomplete pair of bone tweezers and a bone pin without a head. The pin is decorated along two thirds of its length with a carved spiral grooveGrave adjacent to the funerary pyre. Note grave was large enough to contain an inhumation (1.5m x 0.9m wide & 0.45m deep) yet contained a cleaned pile of cremated bone in the north end The grave may have been open for a while as the sides were eroded and suggested evidence of inwash and heavy rain and puddling and grooves had been made with ox scapulae ",4,1,,"Dagger [Camerton-Snowshill], Whetstone , Tweezers, Pin (Unknown/Unspecified)",Cremation

He was laid in a shallow, oval grave in the chalk in a crouched position with his legs to the right and his head pointing south-east. Only small traces of the head of the right humerus were seen and it is thought that a wound was probably sustained here before death. A bronze La Tene II brooch lay above his right shoulder. On his breast was a fine bronze ring, flatterned on one side and with a bronze stud on it, which could have been used to fasten clothing or a baldric. Also lying on his breast was an iron spearhead. The haft of this was probably made of wood but no trace of it remained. In his left hand he still held a chalk pommel from the handle of a weapon best described as a hammer. The iron tang of the hammer handle was lying near to the corroded iron head. a sword, c. 80cm long, lay along the right side of the body, resting on one kneecap. There were no remains of a handle grip on the tang but traces of the wood of the scabbard were still adhering to the blade. Two strips of Bronze nearby could have come from the binding of the scabbard; a bronze bar with linear Celtic decoration was still in place around the top with two iron suspension rings - one on each side of it.

In construction it was similar to Knowe 1 and on the kerb of stones was an ard share. Also in the kerb and evidently a constructional part of it were the broken flagstones of a cist. The knowe was capped with unburnt stones of small size and irregular shape. The ancient turf was only visible on the sides of the mound. The primary burial At a depth of 0á4 m from the turf line and directly beneath the stone capping, an irregularly shaped flagstone was encountered. This proved to be the capstone of a small cist constructed of thin, dressed flags, 0á27 m by 0á24 m and 0á27 m deep. This had been erected on the old ground surface and there was no basal flag. A carefully designed superstructure of large, undressed boulders surrounded the cist and apparently had the function of protecting it from collapsing.The cist contained a small heap of cremated bone and one sherd of pottery.

60067,73863,Primary,,,Cist,Unknown,"<Hedges 1979, Quoyscottie, Knowe 3, primary burial/SF114; 122>:Knowe 3 was generally reduced in height and appeared to be damaged to the NE by a trackway. It was 5 m in diameter and had a maximum preserved height of 0á64 m. In construction it resembled Knowes 1 and 2, but the kerb was much less substantial. An ard share was found on the kerb of this knowe too. The stones of the kerb were all very small - stones from the original kerbing may have been reused during the construction of Knowe 2.The primary burial was encountered 0á46 m below the turf line. The cist was in a very ruinous state but there was no indication that the barrow had been opened. There was a basal flag, 0á55 m by 0á68 m and 55 mm thick which was broken at its S end, resting on the old ground surface. There were four large, undressed stones, one of which was burnt, sloping inwards towards where the cist should have been, but all that remained of the latter were several broken pieces of thin flagstone in various stages of collapse from a vertical position. There was no capstone. Two separate piles of cremated bone were found on the basal flag together with three sherds of pottery. One heap was beneath the fallen flagstones, and the other was on the N edge of the basal flag, apparently outside the area of the cist. The heap beneath the collapsed cist was of human bones - probably a child - whilst the other appears to have been of animal boneshr: F71 Primary burial, Knowe 3. Contained skull fragments and long bone fragments suggesting a child.gg: SF114 Two body sherds which fit together, although found separately. Fabric relatively hard, orange  black outside and in, abraded. Found in the primary burial cist of Knowe 3 intermixed with the cremated bone and ash. SF122 A small body sherd with the inner surface destroyed. Very friable, black in colour. Found in the primary burial cist of Knowe 3 intermixed with the cremated bone and ash (recorded together as an assemblage here)Cremated animal bone?: The heap of cremated bone outside the cist area contained a small portion of jawbone with several sockets. Part of the nasal floor or floor of the maxillary sinus can be seen. Even allowing for shrinkage in cremation, the distance between this surface and the sockets seems very small, yet the sockets cannot be those of deciduous teeth since no crypts for the permanent successors are present. The small fragments of  root embedded in this piece of bone proves on examination under the binocular microscope to have no parent root canal at all, and perhaps the most likely explanation is that it is a retained apex from a shed deciduous tooth. The two broken teeth are equally difficult to identify. In one of them, the broken crown flares out from the root at an angle almost too extreme even for a deciduous tooth. One begins to wonder whether the jaw fragments and teeth are human (identified in the main report as animal bone so defined here as a pyre good).",2,1,,"Assemblage, Animal Bone (Other)",Cremation

The urn was highly ornamented with punched circular, scored and cord impressed decoration, and four applied handles.Calkin (1960, 1962) comments further on the unusual character of this hybrid urn, described overall as a hybrid collared urn with horseshoes. These include the narrow collar decorated inside and out (a feature of food vessels); the four, applied semi-eliptical horseshoe handles on the upper body (a feature of biconical urns), overhanging towards the top for added grip; shoulder ridges with impressed decoration.

In the middle of this heap, level with the surface of the natural ground, and not enclosed in any limited space, there was a considerable quantity of black ashes, which had been evidently burnt on the spot.

About three feet from the western end, and two below the surface, the workmen arrived at a black greasy mould mixed with particles of charcoal, which occupied the entire breadth of the trench, and extended to within a foot of its centre. Beneath this, to a depth varying from two to five inches, was a bed of incinerated brown-coloured clay, having much the appearance of coarse brick. This evidently was the site of the funeral pile. On arriving at the middle, several fragments of an urn were found intermixed with portions of bones, and dark earth ; but no stones were seen that could have protected the remains from the surrounding soil.

Further big stones were found, in particular a quartz lump of % cwt (38 kg) and two smaller stones, which led the excavator to wonder whether there had been a cist. Beneath the slate slabs and the 'clean stones' were fragments of bone and charcoal, mixed with 'broken clean subsoil and shillet' as well as two or three flints, a holed stone and a notched stone. The latter were given letters like those found associated with the cairn ring (see above) and the holed stone T has been identified.

The bone was dated to 2140-1860 cal BC; 3600 +/- 50 BP; (GrA-19988) (Sheridan 2002)'Near the centre were the remains of an urn of clay with small flat stones carefully built around it, placed upright upon a flag measuring 2 feet 6 inches by 1 foot.The base of the vessel, which stood tilted slightly to the west, was 2 feet below the surface of the mound. The upper part was amissing, and the part of the body remaining was full of cracks.Four double handfuls of cremated bones, many with cramp adhering, were found in the vessel.The urn, which was made of very dark, friable ware, had to be removed piecemeal, but though several fairly large fragments were got out, their edges were so crumbly that they could not be fitted together. When complete the vessel must have been a large one, of flower-pot shape, with a wide base. As it lay in its cavity it measured internally [22 cm] across the base, and [28 cm] in height on the best preserved side. At this height an internal diameter of nearly [38 cm] was indicated.

The quantity of bone recovered from this cremation pit was notably higher than from those to the north, and it possibly contained most of the bones from a complete individual. It is tentatively suggested that the individual was male, perhaps of some maturity (Clough, forthcoming).

This is a unique feature for a Thanet round barrow and is quite probably a rare occurrence generally.A large fragment of whalebone had been placed across this grave, a little to one side.Within the grave were the remains of a child, perhaps between 9-10 years of age (of unknown sex). The body had been laid in a crouched position on its right-hand side, with the head facing south-east. The tightly crouched position suggests that child's body may have been bound or wrapped before it was placed within the grave (Boast, Gardner and Moody 2006).Once backfilled, a large fragment of whalebone had been placed across one side of the grave. Whalebone is found only rarely on excavations in Thanet. This piece presumably came from a carcass that could have been washed up on a local beach and was likely viewed as a rare and prized resource.It appears that the whalebone would not have been visible on the surface however, for it had been covered by a small mound of earth which overlapped the edge of the grave-cut. It also appears that the barrow ditch had been purposely backfilled 'soon after the burial had been inserted' (Boast, Gardner and Moody 2006).",2,1,,"Animal Bone (Other), Wrap",Inhumation

There were no complete long bones, but some ends and fragments of arm and leg bones from individuals of different ages.Gg: A small bronze awl was found at the northern edge of the cluster.Clusters 2 and 3:Hr: Two further clusters of human bones (comprising c. 100 elements in total) were deposited on a separate layer of sand, adjacent to Cluster 1. These clusters lay roughly east/west and parallel to each other, and the sand was stained darker brown around the bones. The bones represented at least two adults, probably females, an infant and a child of six or seven. The skeletal elements represented were similar to those in Cluster 1 although more pelvic and long bones were identified, including an articulated adult radius and ulna. Other skeletal elements were arranged in broadly correct anatomical order even though they were not articulated. Elements from individuals of different ages were often combined.Gg: The sand around one group of bones (comprising two leg bones and an upper arm bone lying parallel to each other, another lower leg bone and some large skull fragments) was darker brown, perhaps indicating that the bones had been wrapped in cloth or other organic material.Whoever positioned the bones also placed two jet beads with them.

Given the depth of the pit it seems likely that the small quantity of bone and pottery is not result of any taphonomic or diagenetic process, but was deliberate at the time of burial. Since all of the urns were inverted the only urn base to survive was from Pot 6, possibly resulting from the base collapsing into the void made by the pot at some point in antiquity.

Both of these surfaces have a narrow faceted edge.The object had not been burnt and is not heavily worn.X-ray fluorescence spectroscopy confirmed that the material was an iron- and carbon-rich stone - definitely not jet. In macroscopic appearancethe material closely resembles Kimmeridge shale.It is clear that the Cefn Cwmwd stud had not accompanied the body on the pyre, since it would otherwise have been consumed in the flames. It must have been kept back and added to the cremated bones at the time of interment.HR:Brickley in Cuttler et al 2012, 216-7: 345g burnt human bone; adolescent; sex undetermined",2,1,,"Pot [Collared Urn], Stud",Cremation

Possibly as a consequence of this there was no evidence for an urn. The pit still contained 128g of bone from an adult, and a burnt quoit-shaped faience bead (SF292). Heavy discolouration and damage to the glaze suggests that it had been worn by the corpse on the funeral pyre.GG:Bowman et al in Cuttler et al 2012, 145-9: Quoit shaped faience bead. The identification of one of the white fragments embedded in the surface of the Cefn Cwmwd bead as bone indicates that the bead had been through the pyre, and thus would have been worn on the body during the cremation: the surface of the bead would have melted,and trapped the cremated bone fragments as it subsequently cooled.The weathered flake scars relate to ancient damage. However, whether this is due to the way the bead had been threaded and worn is unclear ... the flaking could have occurred during the cremation process.HR:Brickley in Cuttler et al 2012, 216-7: 128g burnt human bone; adult; sex undetermined",1,1,,Bead(s),Cremation

Excavation revealed it to comprise a mound of earth over a cairn of small stones and earth which covered a pair of concentric kerbs of large stones. The kerbs enclosed a central area with a cist. The circular outer kerb was left open to view; the inner kerb, ellliptical in plan meauring 6.2m N-S  and 7.4m E-W, touched the outer kerb on the western side.  No entrance gaps were left in the kerbs. A low cairn of smallish stones and earth was raised over the kerbs and central area; on this was an outer covering of yellow sandy soil in which were four or five incomplete pots. Two vessels were in the Trevisker style, another possibly so, and one, perhaps two, were plain (b9). No organic layer representing a buried land surface was noted beneath the barrow mound: only 2.5-5.1cm of reddish soil.Burnt material was located immediately west of the mound's centre, beneath the barrow floor, represented by a charred area (1.2m x 2.3m) and on this lay a mass of charcoal with a few fragments of bone. The charring reached a depth of only 5.1cm (b8). Radiocarbon dating of an oak heartwood sample from this deposit returned a date of 3510 70 BP (HAR-8099) - current calibration provides a date of 2_ 2030-1660 cal BC. This date can be taken as a terminus post quem for the construction of the barrow and for the pottery incoporated in its capping (b10).A cist measuring 0.48m by 0.3m, constructed from Cataclews stone, was found in the south-east part of the inner kerb.

The barrows were excavated by WC Borlase in 1872 (b4) and have been mentioned or described by a number of authors (b2-b8). According to Borlase they are joined to each other on their north sides by a low semi-circular earth bank; the distance between the two being ""38 paces"". They are Scheduled Monuments (h1) and were surveyed by the OS in 1971 (h2). Borlase describes this barrow as being 26.3m in diameter by 4.0m high, with a depression 0.46m deep in its top. A shaft, 3.7m in diameter, was sunk from the top to the centre of the barrow. Below the turf was a 0.9m deep layer of stones, overlying a 1.5m deep layer of yellow clay, under which was a second layer of stones (some burnt), covering a large slate slab. A secondary burial, consisting of a deposit of burnt bones and ashes (and a single flint chip), was found 1.5m below the barrow surface in the yellow clay immediately over the centre of this stone, which was level, with the ground surface, about 2.7m by 3.1m by 0.6m thick and sealed a cist.

One side of the area of it was almost entirely taken over by a natural rock protruding through the surface. On the south side a large rock covered a cist containing chips and two limpet shells. Outside the cist, to its south end Borlase found a little urn and in the centre of the barrow sherds of domestic pottery. The urn was found full of black earth and ashes, and ornamented by a double chevron pattern around the rim. Measuring 12cm high and 10cm diamater at the base, and 8.9cm at the mouth, it is barrel-shaped with a perforated cleat on either side and of dark and thin pottery. It had been placed mouth downwards (b1). Abercromby in 1912 records a cinerary urn from Escalls Cliff, measuring 14cm in height, in Truro museum (b8). Patchett in 1944 classifies the urn as Class C, ribbon-handled ii, Middle Bronze Age. Decoration is of the period but the shape of the urn is of the older native tradition, suggesting an example early in the series (b9). Henderson describes the barrow and mentions traces of a similar barrow and a few metres to the south (28467) (b2). The OS who surveyed the barrow at 1:2500 in 1960 found it situated on the summit of a natural round near the cliff top and sited at SW 3622 2722.

",552,"The site of a Middle Bronze Age barrow which was damaged in 1850 and 1870, excavated in 1957 and found to contain several pits and cists. It is marked on the 1963 and 1974 OS maps. In 1850 Rodd reports a discovery by workmen. The barrow has been cut down and shaped to form part of a fence or bank, and an urn (see 4651.01) containing a cremation was found inverted inside a cist, the stones of which were replaced (b2). Further damage to the barrow was caused in 1870 by the insertion of a large concrete block for a flagpole and smaller ones for stays. There was also damage at the edges from ploughing (b3). In 1957 the remains of the barrow were excavated by Dudley (b6). The mound was shown to have originally been capped by small stones and shillet. Sections of a surrounding ring wall were found, showing it to be oval, averaging 0.6m high, and loosely built of large slabs of slate mixed with blocks of local stone. The barrow interior appeared to have been levelled in places to receive cists and pits but no primary burial was found (this was probably on the highest point, near the concrete flagstaff base). However, by analogy of construction and pottery the barrow seems to date to the Middle Bronze Age. The cist uncovered in 1850 was reclocated in 1957 and its position towards the edge of the barrow and immediatley beneath the barrow cover suggested that it was a secondary burial. The description of the cover stone given by Rodd did not correspond with the related port-hole slab found by Dudley. Several miniature cists were found in the south-east quadrant of the barrow. They contained tiny quartz pebbles, little stones and fragments of broken flint. A slight stain in the bottom may have resulted from the former presence of carbonaceous matter. Two small pits were found in the north-east quadrant. One, 20cm deep, contained no finds; the other, 30cm by 46cm and 13cm deep, was covered by a slate slab and contained tiny quartz pebbles and fragments of broken flint. A neolithic adze was also found (4651.02). The barrow is listed as extant (b7) but it is unclear what remains. An Iron Age hut circle is set into the west side of the barrow (4652).<MCO627>: A cremation urn found in 1850 inverted in a cist beneath Glendorgal barrow (4651). It has been mentioned or described by a number of authors (b1-b4). According to Patchett the urn is Bronze Age, probably a late type, after 700 BC (b5). However Thomas suggests that it might date to the Middle Bronze Age or the latter part of the Early Bronze Age. He describes the urn as roughly bucket shaped, narrowing at the base. The paste is yellowish in colour, sandy and gritted heavily with tiny pebbles and well fired. The decoration is poorly executed in scratched technique, three horizontal and irregularly disposed grooves superimposed on a continous running chevron or horizontal zig zag. The urn is now at the RIC. It is one of three Cornish urns reproduced in minature as a cross china design (late C19 to early C20 souvenirs).",http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MCO2625&resourceID=1020,,,1,,1,HER_Cornwall,MonUID,MCO2625,PrefRef,4651,,,,#N/A,,,,,2

Beneath the mound a grave pit was found (already emptied by the farmer, whose account suggests it may have held a cremation), a fire site and a charcoal patch. Pieces of pottery ""of Bronze Age fabric"" were found, and a holed and cupped stone. The most remarkable discovery was the remains of an oak wood 'Cornish' shovel in the bottom of the ditch (b3). A collection of lithic material was deemed to relate to earlier prehistoric activity in the area (25007.1) In 1970, the site was visited by the OS, who reported no visible remains - the mound was presumably destroyed after the excavation during construction of the wartime airfield.

Henderson in 1932 describes it containing a enclosed chamber with a probable false entrance on the east side inside which Borlase found bone and an urn (28469.2) (b3). Daniel in 1950 describes a very curious structure consisting of a central chamber or cist, 1.8m long by 1.2m wide and 1.4m high, with a second chamber or cist only 0.45m high adjoining it. He notes that superficially the structure resembles a miniature passage grave but agrees with Hencken (b2) that the feature is merely two cists of differing dimensions placed in juxtaposition in the barrow (b4). The OS who surveyed the barrow at 1:2500 in 1960 record that all that remains of the cist is a short north-south passageway covered by a granite slab 1.4m long and 1.3m wide, supported on its east side by two stones set on edge, and on the west by two similar but recumbant stones. One of these projects well outside the west edge of the capstone. The only other stone, which may be in situ, is set on edge to the north east of the covering slab.

The OS who surveyed the remains of the chambered tomb in 1960, record no remains of the barrow (h2). Russell in 1971 lists no extant remains of the barrow in her entry for the chambered tomb (b11). The tomb, which is oriented north-east/south-west, was found to be open at the north east end. The chamber seems to have been rectangular and measures 3.0m by 1.5m. Daniel records no remains of a barrow and only the remains of one upright stone measuring 1.5m square, which was probably the south west stone of the chamber, with the capstone leaning against it (b6). Barnatt records that two sides of the chamber were removed in 1820 and 1861 (b14). West Lanyon Quoit is shown on the OS map of 1908 (b5) and is a Scheduled Monument (b7). The OS who surveyed the site at 1:2500 in 1960 record that the upright stone is 1.6m high and 1.5m wide. The capstone, which rests against it, is 4.1m long and 2.6m wide (h2, p1). The site was revisited by the OS in 1975 when no change is recorded to the survey of 1960 (h3). It is marked on the OS map of  1963 (b8), and Russell in 1971 lists the extant remains of a capstone and one supporter (b11).  Sheppard in 1982 reports the field to be in pasture (h5, b13).

Possibly in situ pyre ",236,"Edmunds in 1848 describes Bosporthennis cromlech as a small dismounted quoit (b1) and WC Borlase who excavated the site in 1872 records the site of an urn (30729.11). He also recounts the story of a miller said to have trimmed the corner stone intending to use it for a millstone but afterwards abandoning it (b3). Daniel in 1950 thinks it should properly be classed as a large surface cist (b6). The chamber, or cist, is about 1.2m high, 0.9m wide and 1.5m long. The capstone is nearly circular and 1.5m in diameter and about 0.15m thick. The slab that forms the south-west side is 1.8m long, the supporting stone on the other side is missing, and on that side the cover stone lies prostrate on the ground. The north-west end consists of a single stone, the south-east end consists of  two stones. Around these remains is a heap of earth and stones forming the remains apparently of a barrow (30729) which once covered it (b1). The OS who surveyed the site at 1:2500 in 1961 record that Edmonds' description is correct, except that the single side stone is on the south side not the south-west as he states. This and the stone at the western end are upright and rest against each other. There are several stones at the eastern end but all are considerably smaller than that at the west, and are almost certainly not in situ (h1). Russell in 1971 lists the extant remains of a cist and displaced capstone (b7), and the OS who revisited the site in 1975 record no change from the survey of 1961 (h2). Weatherhill in 1977 suggests the monument may represent a transitional stage between the Penwith chamber tomb and a cist, being too small to be classified as the former but too large to be of the latter (h3, b8). Planned at 1:50 in 1983 by CCRA; the south-east end stone appears displaced. Small clearance stones dumped on 'capstone'. The cist appears slightly south of centre mound (h4, b10, b11, b12, b13). Bosporthennis Quoit is situated within a small rectangular field bounded by high and massively thick walls. The orthostats forming the chamber or cist are still deeply embedded in a stone and earth barrow, ovoid in plan and measuring 6.7m by 5.8m and reaching a height of 0.8m, with the scant remains of a kerb. The condition of the monument appears to have changed little since it was excavated by WC Borlase in 1872 who found sherds (30729.11) and calcined bones within the chamber (h3, b8). The site is described by Edmonds in 1848 (b1) and WC Borlase in 1872 (b3). It is also illustrated and mentioned by Blight (b2, b4). The OS in 1961 surveyed the site at 1:2500 and record a main barrow mound extending from it to the south, but nowhere more than 0.1m high, being almost ploughed out (h1, p1). The OS revisited the site in 1975 when they record no change from the 1961survey (h2). Russell in 1971 records the barrow and lists the extant remains of the cist and capstone (30729.1)(b7). The site was planned at 1:50 by CCRA in 1983 who record low kerb stones to the north and north-east; the mound was measured as 6.7m by 6.1m overall but approx 5.5m in diameter if the kerb continued its line to the south. The mound reaches approx 1.0m high (h4, b10, b11, b12, b13).",http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MCO27513&resourceID=1020,,,1,,1,HER_Cornwall,MonUID,MCO27513,PrefRef,30729,,,,#N/A,,,,,1

The barrow is located at the western, seaward end of the island on the most exposed part and survives as a distinct knoll. The site displays two phases of activity. During the first phase a stone ring of single course slates demarcated an area, 7m in diameter and approximately 1.3m in height, of a small sandy mound overlying an original land surface. Within the sandy deposit small amounts of disarticulated human bone were found, along with shell midden material and in situ knapped flints of Early Bronze Age typology. Flints of probable Late Mesolithic/Early Neolithic date were also recovered from the old land surface beneath the sandy mound.The second phase involved the construction of a stone monument, comprising basal slates laid flat, overlying and capping part of the sandy mound. The cist, a stone-lined box of vertical overlapping slate slabs, 1.4m long by 1m wide and 0.7m deep, was constructed at the same time and is associated with the deposition of a single individual. The presence of an organic soil horizon between the primary mound and capping stones indicate that the two phases are likely to be separated by several centuries.

The cairn was the focus for a number of cremations (9), six of which were associated with urns. The cairn had several structural phases. Within the main central body two adjacent features contained urned cremation burials and appear to have been the primary burials around which the cairn was designed. Placed outside the cairn kerb were a further six irregularly spaced satellite burials, four of which contained complete pots. Two further pits, shallow and truncated by ploughing, were located north-east of the cairn kerb with one containing a fragment of pottery.Finds included Trevisker style cremation urns, worked flint debitage, an amber bead, an ovoid slate disc, quartz crystals and a worked pebble (b7). A buried soil sampled from beneath the kerbed stones, provided a calibrated radiocarbon date 2280-1780BC. Radiocarbon dates from the cremation urns showed the monument to have been in use during the  Middle Bronze Age with the period c1800-1500 cal BC proposed as the bracket in which it was at one time built and used (b7). The site was reinstated after excavation and now sits in an area of enclosed croft (h4).Charcoal (Quercus sp.) was extracted from the top of the old land surface beneath cairn 38, context OLS 534 (7). The charcoal occurred over a fairly wide area and was scattered; ie it was not just a result of a small fire but may be the result of clearance of the woodland prior to the construction of the cairn. Radiocarbon dating from an oak sample from this deposit returned a date of 3650 80 BP (HAR-6548) - current calibration provides a date of 2_: 2280-1770 cal BC (b9).--------------------------------Site history:1: 1960.

The pot and gold cup were set beneath a slab leaning against the west wall of the cist.",521,"The Rillaton Barrow is the second largest barrow or cairn on Bodmin Moor (the largest being that on Showery Tor). It is located towards the south-east end of a broad spur in open moorland which has been extensively exploited for minerals and stone. The barrow is a component in a major prehistoric ritual landscape which includes the Hurlers triple stone circles (1402) and Stowe's Pound (1401). One of the richest prehistoric graves in Cornwall was discovered here in either 1818 (according to Borlase), or 1837 (according to Smirke). It was found by miners (Polsue) or labourers looking for stone (Smirke). The find was not described until 1868 (Smirke). The following account is based on Borlase's report of 1872:""A pile of stones 90ft diameter covered an oblong cavity 8ft by 3ft 6in by 3ft high. Each of the sides of this grave was formed of three stones set on edge, one placed in the same manner closed each end, a long flat stone lay at the bottom and a tenth stone covered the whole. Along the floor lay the remains of a skeleton ""extended"". Near the breast stood an earthenware pot and within it the gold cup. A flat stone 16in square leaning diagonally against the western side of the cist covered and protected these vessels. The earthenware vessel was broken in removing it but the fragments exhibited the usual incised ornamentation of the early British pottery. Other relics were found in the same tomb, but are unfortunately mislaid - they comprised a small piece of ornamental earthenware, a bronze spearhead , ten inches long, something like a metallic rivet, pieces of ivory and a few glass beads.""The gold cup, lost for many years, is the only find still remaining. It was rediscovered in King George V's dressing room, being used as a container for collar studs, and is now in the British Museum"".Hencken dates the cist burial to the Early Bronze Age, but points out that it was probably not a primary feature of the cairn, as the cist was built a little above ground level into the outer edge of the mound. It is sited on the eastern side of the cairn, 1.0m below the top, and has been exposed by a pit or excavation trench. It is difficult to know to what extent it has been rebuilt but it is in good condition. Internally, it measures 2.2m by 1.1m, and it is 0.9m deep from roof to floor. The backstone, cover stone and ends consist of single slabs; the east side, exposed by the pit, has four slabs, a small gap between them allowing access to the chamber. Barnatt adds that the cist is oriented north-south. Growing on the stones within the cist is a green phosphorescent moss which was first noted in 1936 and is still visible today (ie. 2003).The barrow was surveyed by the OS in 1974 and resurveyed from the air and on the ground by the RCHME in 1985 when it was described as a turf covered cairn 34m in diameter and from 2.0m to 2.7m high, much dug into at the sides and on the top, which is about 15m across and mostly occupied by a large pit.The Rillaton Barrow was Scheduled in the mid 1950s.

It was excavated by Pool and Russell in 1958 and 1962 (h1, h3) and subsequent reports appeared in Proceedings of the West Cornwall Field Club and Cornish Archaeology (b1-b4). Excavation showed that the menhir stood by a cairn of stones, below which was a cremation and a beaker vessel contained within a cist (31514.01). The menhir was erected before the cist but it is probable that they form a single monument. Sherds found on the surrounding soil suggest the insertion of secondary burials which have since been scattered by ploughing (b4). The standing stone is of triangular section, tapering upwards. At the base, the sides are 0.6m wide and the stone is 2.5m high. There are no surface remains of the cairn (h2).

All the stones are quartz and vary in height between 1.0m and 2.4m. The stone circle was reconstructed in the mid 1800s (7)WC Borlase relates two conflicting stories about the urn which was found at this site. In an account of the attempt in 1861 to re-erect three (?) fallen stones, credited to one Mr Pedlar, the urn was recovered from beneath one of the stones. A fragment of this urn is illustrated by Borlase. However, Mr NHP Lawrence of Launceston subsequently stated in a letter (to TH Bewes and seen by Borlase) that the urn was recovered from a hedge that bisected the circle when this was removed, either before 1858 or between 1861-63. Human bone was found inside the urn. Borlase inferred from these details that a burial monument or cairn had been raised inside the circle.Patchett (1946) lists the urn as Class 'G' Deverel-Rimbury style which she ascribes to the Late Bronze Age and dates to ""after 750 BC"".The circle is in excellent condition but recent plans to make the farm into a tourist attraction might disturb the nature of the site.The stone circle was plotted from aerial photographs (p1) during the Cornwall NMP.--------------------------------Site history:1: 1971.

10162,Harlyn Bay #4,"HARLYN BAY - Bronze Age round house (domestic), Iron Age cemetery",Cornwall,CORNWALL,St Merryn,CEMETERY,Inhumation Cemetery,Cemetery,187790,75290,"An Iron Age cemetery with over 100 graves, part of a walled structure and lots of artefacts were revealed by excavations at Harlyn Bay in 1900 and 1976<gg_summary>: c. 130 graves excavated between 1900-1906 during the excavation of foundations for a house. In his detailed rexamination of the site archive Whimster (1977; 1979) was able to reconstruct the location of 53 of these graves and to extract the basic details from a further 7 graves. Only 6 of these recorded graves were associated with grave goods. Additionally Whimster established a list of surviving grave goods from all of the graves (and possibly also from other elements of this site). These (minus the items mentioned within the six located graves) are attributed to a single grave record here. Two items most likely to be of late 1st century AD date or later (a bow brooch frag; a double segmented glass bead) are not recorded for now.Overall, Whimster (1977, 80) states that 'taken alone the Harlyn grave goods indicate a materially impoverished community whose few  ornamental possessions were obtained as a result of sporadic, wide-ranging trade with both central southern England and south-western Europe during the later centuries of the pre-Roman Iron Age.",1236,"During site works in advance of the construction of a house at Harlyn Bay in 1900, the remains of an Iron Age cemetery were revealed. An excavation was undertaken by Mr Reddie Mallett (apparently the owner of the site) (b1), and about 110 graves were discovered. Part of a curved wall was also found,  with two burials found beneath its foundation, which were interpreted as 'votive offerings' (b9). The other burials were in graves  aligned N-S, with the head at the north, and the bodies were crouched or contracted (b1,9). The interments (not cremations) were accompanied by a range of bronze, iron and ceramic grave goods (b5,9). The 'excavation archive' now held by the Royal Cornwall Museum, in Truro (b8), consists of the excavator's notes and a guidebook written by Mr Buller in 1912 (b3), which is extremely confused. Finds from the excavation of the cemetery at Harlyn Bay in 1900 are listed separately in records detailing metalwork, pottery, stone, bone and shell because of the difficulty of associating individual finds with particular graves or excavated contexts 21700.3-.6). It appears from the original excavation archive notes that only a few of the burials had grave goods, and of those found it is not clear what proportion eventually found their way to Truro Museum.  In 1976, the site was re-examined by Rowan Whimster when the building that had been used as a museum was to be extended into a bungalow (b9). Although only a small area was excavated, the written and artefactual archives were re-examined and it was possible to clarify the interpretation of the site. However, the site archive contained details of only 40 of  the burials - the other 70 remain unlocated. The main feature revealed by Whimster was a length of drystone walling set on a clay-bonded foundation course dug into the old ground surface (b9). This was considered to be part of the same feature as that seen in 1900, which was interpreted as part of a  'ritual structure',  a conclusion accepted by Whimster.  This feature was deliberately demolished not long after construction. No new burials were found, and only one pit  from the 1900 excavations was encountered.  Because the acid soils of Cornwall destroy all traces of bone, this site, inundated by dune sand, is one of the few with surviving human skeletal material making it  one of  the most important prehistoric sites in the county.Charcoal samples from the floor of the circular building and from an old land surface prior to the inundation of the site by dune sand both gave dates in the Middle Bronze Age. The circular structure (house?) was dated to 3320-3600 BP (1820-2100 BC) and the OLS to 3460-3640 BP (1960-2140 BC).  The circular structure therefore appears to be a middle Bronze Age round house rather than an Iron age 'ritual structure'.  This highlights doubts about the accuracy of the 1900 excavation archive and also about whether Whimster's wall and the 1900 wall are in fact parts of the same structure. It also recalls Nowakowskis' discovery at Trethellan Farm,Newquay, of  Iron Age burials over the remains of a  Bronze Age village (PRN 171472).--------------------------------Site history:2: 1954.

In 1954 a cist from the area to the north of the main cemetery was revealed in a cliff fall, and was excavated by Dudley (b3-5). It is likely  that this burial was of late iron age date, but from a different tradition to the site at Harlyn Bay. It is interesting that a site should be used as a cemetery over such a long time span, and for, presumably, both pagan and christain burials. In 1994 a human radius and ulna and fragments of long bone were found approx 100m to the north-east after ground disturbance associated with coastal protection works (37279).

The vessel contained cremated bone from several individuals with some animal bone, quartz pebbles, and a small bronze pendant. A radiocarbon date on the cremated bone fell in the range 2120_1880 cal BC and is a valuable addition to the small number of securely-dated Early Bronze Age burials in Cornwall with metalwork associations.

Two small orthostats defined the entrance, but no capstones remained. The contents consisted of four stratified deposits including the remains of at least 22 urns, 60 cremated individuals and other finds. In the cairn around the chamber was an internal kerb within which were two satellite burials.

Ashbee also describes it as a chambered cairn, but O'Neil, who excavated the site in 1953, classified the tomb as a cist rather than a chamber because it seemed to be closed at both ends. It was triangular or boat-shaped, 2.4m long and 1.2m wide, aligned NNE-SSW, and without parallel in Scilly. A stone kerb surrounding the cist left room for a little filling, but there was no trace of loose stones or earth in the vicinity, suggesting that there may never have been a covering cairn or barrow.

The cemetery consisted of 21 oval, sub-oval or sub-rectangular inhumation pits, of which only 14 produced in-situ human bone, though disturbed bone fragments were found in the backfill of two graves.  Some of the graves produced metalwork which was instrumental in assessing the date and duration of this activity.

The top is slightly inclined towards the centre and a large outcropping rock is built into the south side of the wall. The cairn is very spread and mutilated by two excavations within the walling. The natural rock and shallow depression mentioned by Borlase is just inside the north circumference of the wall. The depression may be natural as two other large rocks near the cairn here have well formed rock basins. No trace remains of the cist which Borlase discovered (h1). Russell in 1971 listed the extant remains of the cairn (b7), and the OS who revisited the site in 1975 record no change from the survey in 1960 (h2).

Located and surveyed by the OS during field investigation in 1973 (h1) and subsequently marked on the OS 1:10000 map (b1). Excavated in 1978 (site crivc) in advance of flooding of Colliford reservoir (h2, b2). Nevertheless, the site was visible from the air in 1979 (p1) and is depicted on the RCHM's air photo plot (h3, b3). The site of the cairn is now under water. In 1973, the OS described this cairn as in good condition, with a diameter of 7.5m and 0.6m high (h1). Excavation suggested that this cairn had been rather less carefully constructed than the others in the group, although a central pit complex was carefully made and there was evidence of precise setting-out. The body of the cairn was of turf and stone, covering a central pit containing some cremated bone. The old ground surface was preserved beneath the mound; piercing this in the centre was a stake-hole - possibly for a stake used in marking out the perimeter of the cairn. East of this a pit 0.8m in diameter and 0.35m deep had been cut in the old land surface. This was filled with charcoal (mature oak timbers, RC dated 3580+-80bp, 1630BC) and cremated human bone. The sides of the pit were burnt, either because the contents had been burnt here, or because they were deposited hot. Several stones, a layer of clay and two large stones sealed the pit. Around the pit, on the OLS were several charcoal scatters and sealing these, a layer of yellow ash. The turf stack, a very disorderly affair, was raised over this. Within it was found a small inverted pot and a cluster of stones - close together but separated by turfs and possibly not related. Around the edge of the stack a series of large stones were set, whose temporal relationship with the turf mound is uncertain. Small stones were firmly embedded in the top of most of the body of the stack, except on the SE, and above these, a layer 1-2 thick of small loosely placed stone. The cairn appears to have lain undisturbed since construction. The pot or 'pygmy cup' is fully described on pp 79-81 of the report.

By the middle of the C19, when it was described by WC Borlase, the capstone had slipped and the western upright supporting it had snapped (b2). It was planned and drawn in great detail by Lukis (1885) when the northern of the two fa ade slabs (at the chamber's eastern end) had been reduced in height by the splitting off of a post  in 1861 (b14). The most useful references are Wailes (1957) and Barnatt (1982). The latter includes an accurate modern large scale plan.As it survives today the site comprises two chambers set into a low stony mound. The main  chamber is trapezoidal with its long axis running 75 degrees to the NNE. The western end is 0.83m wide, the eastern end is 1.9m wide; the total length being 3.16m. The capstone is 5.33m by 2.9m and weighs about 9.45 tonnes. An antechamber was formed at the eastern end by two impressive portal stones.No modern excavations have been carried out but several informal diggings were summarised by Thomas and Wailes in 1967 (b10). A pot was found by a local man in the C19. Grenfell and his son dynamited their way in, in 1881 and recovered a whetstone or perforated hone which found its way to Penlee Museum in Penzance (b10). Thomas and Wailes compared the hone with others from Penwith to suggest a Bronze Age date. In 1910 R J Noall of St Ives dug in the main chamber and found eighteen flints, one a scraper, one calcined, some charcoal, some cremated bones (presumably human) and sherds from two small pots. His finds are now in the County Museum in Truro (b10). Mr Hazeldine-Warren found sherds of  well fired cord-impressed ware in rabbit holes immediately outside the entrance to the ante chamber soon after WW1.

When discovered, the cist was found to have been richly furnished with an iron sword in a bronze scabbard. The cist, a box like slab built funerary structure, survives wholly beneath the surface of the modern field containing it, the upper face of its covering slabs lying about 0.4m beneath the present ground surface. The cist is defined by a wall whose main, basal, course comprises relatively large slabs, roughly 0.25m-0.6m long and mostly edge set. Above these, up to two courses of smaller slabs and rubble, generally laid flat, infill irregularities in the upper edge of the basal course and raise the wall to a fairly even upper level about 0.25m-0.3m above the cist floor deposits. The cist is roofed by several cover slabs laid flat over the wall. In some sectors the wall's upper courses project rogressively inwards towards the cover slabs, a technique called corbelling. The walling defines an ovoid internal area with a north-south long axis, approximately 1.5m long by up to 1m wide. The plan is assymetrical: the east side of the cist has a shallower concave curve than the west, and the southern end is rounded while the northern end tapers to a single transverse wall slab rising almost the full height of the cist and very distinctive for its regular rectangular shape. The deposits on the cist floor, undisturbed at the time of the cist's discovery, have a surface layer of dark silts on which is an area of modern ploughsoil which collapsed into the cist on discovery. However beyond the northern edge of that modern debris, the surface within the north of the cist includes a substantial spread of the yellow granitic subsoil locally called ram. The cist was discovered in late March 1999 when pressure from a tractor passing above it caused one of the cover slabs to be displaced and collapse into the cist interior. On removing the displaced slab, the farmer revealed the cavity of the cist and observed an object in the surface deposits. On removal the object proved to be the almost complete remains of an iron sword in a bronze scabbard. The sword had been laid along the western side of the cist with the hilt to the north. Lacking only the upper end of the hilt as originally found, the sword and scabbard together measure 0.86m long. Subsequent authoritative examination of their distinctive features indicates a broadly 3rd century BC date for the sword and scabbard. This cist is situated in a locality rich in surviving remains of funerary and settlement activity from earlier and broadly contemporary periods. Beyond this scheduling, another cist of this type occurs at present inter-tidal levels in Green Bay, 265m to the north east on the Bryher's east coast, while on Samson Hill itself, a cemetery of large Bronze Age funerary cairns extends across the summit dome and an elaborate chambered cairn is sited at Work's Carn on the southern flank. A Late Bronze Age settlement site accompanied by rich occupation and environmental deposits is exposed in the eastern cliff of Samson Hill below Bonfire Carn, while a similar site of Late Bronze Age to Iron Age date occurs in West Porth, Samson, 1.5km south of this cist.

The OS surveyed the site in 1960 at 1:2500 and noted four perimeter stones retaining a mound 6.5m in diameter and 1.1m high (h2). Russell in 1971 listed the extant remains of a barrow with retaining wall and cist (b2). The site was revisited by the OS in 1975 (h3). The site was planned at 1:50 by J Ratcliffe for CCRA in 1984 who re-interpreted it as an entrance grave with a chamber orientated NW-SE defined by six orthostats with an entrance to the south east. Two large stones on the top of the mound were considered to be possible capstones (h5, b4).In 1984 the site was excavated by Charles Thomas for the ICS with help from CCRA and CAS. The intention was to investigate the relationship between the cairn and a nearby round house settlement (30462), and to obtain dating and enviromental evidence. According to Thomas, the cairn is approx 5.0m in diameter with kerbstones averaging 1.0m high with traces of walling between them. A narrow entrance passage, walled with horizontal slabs, widens to form the chamber which is sited slightly north of centre. A probable capstone was found displaced on the top of the stony mound. Excavation of the chamber produced a coarse, friable small pot, with a flat base and a simple round rim, in what he described as the ""West Cornish Late Neolithic and Co-Beaker coarse ware class, now known from a number of sites and contexts"". Charcoal and cremated bone were found in association with the pot in an apparently primary deposit (b1). Two radiocarbon determinations were obtained on the cremated bone giving almost identical dates, falling between 1690 to 1500 cal BC. A clay pipe stem and an iron bar were found in the chamber, presumably relating to the 'opening' of the barrow in the post-medieval period. Some kerb stones were replaced by the excavators. There is a prospecting pit immediately to the NNW of the site. Weston reported the site clear of vegetation in 1987. The excavation has not yet (2001) been published. The monument is included in the Schedule. It is also visible on aerial photographs (p1-2) and was plotted as part of the NMP.--------------------------------Site history:1: 1956. SAUNDERS, AS / MOW2: 1960. PITCHER, GH / OS3: 1975.

It was first recorded by WC Borlase in 1863 (b1) and was 'opened' by him in 1868. Having removed the turf from the mound he observed that ""it became quite evident that that....stones had been taken from it to make the surrounding hedges and their place supplied by a pile of mud and refuse from the road"" so it is difficult to be certain about the original form and ground plan of the monument.  He recorded a ring of perimeter stones and a large inclined capstone 2.7m in diameter and 0.45m thick resting on two uprights at the south and west sides and on the ground on the other side, having apparently been knocked of its supports by what he (probably mistakenly) identified as a menhir. He recorded a great quantity of ashes and bone splinters and a flint flake, but no pottery or metalwork (b2). Henderson gave the position of the barrow, which he said is still visible, as adjoining the hedge and some 90m west of the stile leading to the Merry Maidens field, and noted that the menhir referred to by Borlase had disappeared (b3). The OS surveyed the barrow at 1:2500 in 1960 and recorded the remains of the SE half of a mound which resembled a barrow. This had a maximum height of 2.0m and a diameter of approx 17m which had been augmented by the dumping of field clearance material on the NE and SW. They also recorded that the barrow was cut across by a NE- SW hedge and that there were no traces of a mound on the road verge to the NW of the hedge (h1). Tregiffian barrow was excavated by Dorothy Dudley for the MPBW in 1967 and 1968; she recorded that the barrow may have originally been 12m in diameter. A megalithic passage 4.3m long and 1.2m wide was discovered, surrounded by a setting of large granite slabs 0.9m to 1.2m high, at about 0.9m from the outer edge of this passage. The stones blocking the entrance, one of them cup marked, had been displaced by Borlase. Slightly east of the entrance a 1.1m square granite block, covered with a whole group of cup marks had been set at an angle to the entrance (28192.2). Another large cup marked stone was found lying in the SE quadrant. The floor of the passage was strewn with comminuted bone fragments and below this floor were two pits. An oval one contained charcoal, stone and cremated bone, and a round one held an undamaged urn 38cm high (h2, h3, b4, b5). A further excavation  was carried out by A Apsimon for the DOE, in 1972, to supplement Dudley's work in 1967/68. This  was confined to the completion of the plan of the chamber prior to conservation and restoration (h4, b7). Russell in 1971 listed the site and recorded the extant remains of a barrow with a stone structure (b6). Sheppard in 1982 noted that the ground on each side of the outer ring of stones had been eroded by visitors. The bare strips were approx 3.6m long by 0.6m wide (b8).

In the early C20 the remains of two huts and a cremation with grave goods, were found. There are now negligible remains apart from an underlying layer of flints (21721), probably a scatter from the many well-preserved midden deposits (21730.6 and 21731).

JP Arthur claims the bones were ""arranged in a neat little heap between two small slabs of slate"" (b1) but also has suggested a story about cannibalism following Williams observation that the bones seemed to have been cut up after death; a later specialist report clearly showed the error of this idea but continued by claiming that the body was female, of 5ft 5in height. Claims of this sort  are impossible to substantiate from bones in such poor condition. Some sherds of a black hand made pot were found in the cist, with some flint flakes and a worked piece of quartzite.

Above and to the southwest a larger flat laid slate slab rests upon the upright stones. The arrangement of stones and their position within aeolian deposits suggests a built structure and the most likely interpretation is that these stones represent a cist burial. This is likely to date to the Early Bronze Age. The cist, although visible in the cliff edge, is not at any immediate risk from erosion since it lies on the leeward side of the island. The ground around it is covered with thick grassy vegetation and this is preventing erosion on the scale apparent elsewhere on the island (b1).<MCO46105>: A polished granite implement was recovered during a field survey from an eroding cliff face on the northwestern side of Constantine Island (b1). The tool had been broken in antiquity and the sub-oval fragment recovered measured 11cm by 4cm along its longest face and tapered to a width of 2cm. It has been identified as a lapstone (Carl Thorpe pers comm) used for polishing leather. It is likely to be of prehistoric origin. The stone came from a pocket of the midden material covering the island at a depth of 0.4m below the surface. Numerous fragments of burnt bone were also recovered from the vicinity of the lapstone within the same deposit. The stratigraphy here seemed disturbed in comparison with the well-stratified midden material to either side, perhaps indicating an intrusion into the midden. This might indicate a cist burial eroding out of the cliff, and thus a Bronze Age date, although no structural features were observed.

In 1970 Ashbee (b12) re-erected a fallen capstone and displaced door jamb. An area, 0.6m by 0.4m was excavated in order to reseat the jambstone in position as indicated on Bonsor's plan. About one hundred and forty sherds were recovered from the cutting, representing about eleven vessels and increasing the range found by Bonsor. Two worked flints from Bant's Carn were presented to the Isles of Scilly museum in December 1976. The OS fieldworker (h5) describes Bant's Carn as an entrance grave comprising a massive chamber encircled by two kerbs. The outer kerb is 13m diameter and  0.6m high, and the inner is 8.0m diameter and 1.0m high.

The chamber was boat shaped in plan, 4.9m long and 1.6m wide in the centre, 1.2m wide at either end, and 1.5m high. It was orientated ENE-WSW with the entrance at the east end. The entrance passage was 5.0m long and 1.0m wide. The walling was of coursed stone, with orthostats edging the north west of the passage into the chamber.

He also saw several pits and a number of crouched burials, one with a bowl of the so-called 'war cemetery' type seen at Maiden Castle. Subsequently small excavation was carried out at the point where observations of the trench suggested that occupation was most dense. Two trenches 3m long and 1.5m wide were excavated parallel to the pipeline trench and about 5m from it on either side. In due course the northern trench was abandoned, and the southern one extended to a 3m by 3m square. Immediately below the ploughsoil was a small area of a floor constructed of flat stones packed with puddled chalk. No dating evidence was found, but the floor was interpreted as representing the remnants of a later Romano-British level, largely ploughed out.  An accumulation of dark soil overlay a floor of compacted limestone fragments. Pottery in this dark soil was Durotrigian and Romano-British. This floor sealed a pit, the fillings of which contained a little pottery. Below the floor was a partly broken up floor of stone and shale over a thick layer of black earth and stone over another floor of large stone slabs and a hearth of puddled chalk. Three slabs of shale were found, and the excavators speculated that these may have been the floor of a narrow passageway.  The black layer and ash from the hearth contained Iron Age B and early Durotrigian pottery. Below this was a series of alternating hearths with layers of ash, down to a layer over natural limestone. At this level Iron Age A pottery was found, with fabrics and forms comparable to those at Maiden Castle, Pins Knoll and Chalbury. This pottery included heamatite-coated situlate jars and derivative types, in fabric described as hard, occasionally burnished and varying in colour from bright red to dullish brown. Finds from the site included an unfinished shale armlet and a fragment of another, leading to speculation that there may at some time have been shale working on the site.  It is not clear from the report whether any other shale objects or waste were noted. Other finds included worked bone awls and flat pieces of bone, also worked, and a bone implement possibly associated with weaving.

In 1970 this monument was recorded as being around 54 feet in diameter with a mound about a foot high. A cremation burial was exposed by ploughing in 1988.

The information from this record is as follows:Large fragments of a Middle Bronze Age bucket urn from the cremation pit of a barrow. It is grey to brown in colour and tempered with fragments of grog. The vessel is of medium size, with a simple flat topped rim. It is decorated with four simple oval vertical lugs located below the rim and by horizontal rows of finger-tip impressions just below the rim.The find record relating to this record has been attached to the barrow record in the ggdb.",822,"<MDO1895>: The Bronze Age Urn - Anne Woodward:(1) Large fragments of an urn, which had been broken prior to interment, were found in an apparently primary burial cist, as described above. Much of the rim and body but no fragments of the base were present. The urn is of medium size, with a simple flat topped rim (Fig. 4). It is decorated with four simple oval vertical lugs located 7 cm below the rim and by horizontal rows of finger-tip impressions just below the rim, and between the lugs. The vessel is grey to brown in colour and the fabric is tempered with a medium density of small to large fragments of grog. The urn belongs to a group of medium-sized bucket urns found in the Dorset Downs area (Ellison 1975, Dorset Downs type (d) ). A close parallel is provided by one of the urns from the Deverel Barrow itself (Milborne St Andrew Grinsell No. 14: Grinsell 1968. fig. 12 64e), and other vessels showing similar characteristics are known from the Bagber Barrow, Milborne St Andrew Grinsell No. 2 (Abercromby 1912, No. 445), Milborne St Andrew Grinsell barrow 6h/I (Ellison 1975. PI.93 lower) and the Plush barrow, Piddletrenthide Grinsell No. 10b (ibid PI.98.2 to 4, especially No. 4).The urn was found in a barrow which may have been excavated previously by Cunnington in 1818 (RCHM 1970. 212). His barrow No. 44 may have been RCHM No. (15) Or (16). However the lack of evidence for previous disturbance in the centre of the barrow now investigated suggests that this was not Cunnington's barrow No.44 which had contained a primary cremation (ibid), and that Cunnington 44 was probably RCHM No. (16), equally Grinsell No. 2. Of the three barrows excavated by Cunnington in this vicinity, all contained cremations, and two of them produced sets of urns, five from Cunnington 45 (probably RCHM [18] equals Grinsell No. 4) and a further five from Cunnington 43 (RCHM [16] or [17] equals Grinsell No. 3). There is some confusion as to which of the five urns surviving in Dorset County Museum derived from which barrow, but Acland (1908. 139) states that DCM Nos. 85 (Abercromby 1912 No. 418), 86, 87 (Abercromby 368) and 88 (Abercromby 441) were found in the same barrow. This was probably Cunnington No. 43. DCM No. 91 (Abercromby 404) may therefore have derived from the other barrow which produced urns, Cunnington No. 45, probably equal to RCHM (18). The five surviving urns are all tempered with grog, occasionally with the addition of some fragments of chalk: they include one globular urn, three lugged or cordoned buckets, of different type to that recorded in this note, and one small knobbed cup. On typological grounds it would be expected that the Piddlehinton urn would date from the Middle Bronze Age period and the radiocarbon determination confirms this. The date obtained was as follows: Har-10059               3170 = 80 BP (1200 bc = 80)Calibrated ranges:   one sigma:         1540 cal BC to 1360 cal BC                                 two sigma:         1670 cal BC to 1230 cal BCThis date correlates well with the dates from the Middle Bronze Age cremation cemetery at Knighton Heath (Grinsell 1982. 15) and with the earlier of the dates in the group of determinations obtained from the Simon's Ground cemetery (ibid) and the Deverel-Rimbury burials from the Barrow Pleck, Handley (Barrett, Bradley et al 1981. 234). Although an earlier origin for the Dorset Downs variant of Deverel-Rimbury ceramics is indicated by the single date for a bucket urn from Arne (1740 bc = 90, Grinsell op cit), the general pattern of dates now suggests that this style of pottery was most commonly produced in the 15th to 12th centuries cal BC (12th to 11th centuries bc).(2) MBA pottery exposed by ploughing.

The combined evidence from the Holmewood collection from Druitts diaries and other sources, gives proof for another 26 urns, with 6 more probables, making a total of at least 70 burials. We must also bear in mind that in the part of the cemetery excavated under skilled supervision, Dr Clay found 3 simple cremations for every 2 urns, so it is reasonable to infer that there were between 30-40 plain cremations in the rest of the cemetery.

Beneath the mound were three pits, two interpreted as unoccupied graves. Immediately S.W. of the barrow some fifty-two cremations were discovered, nearly all in urns. Barrel urns were most common, but a few globular urns and one collared urn were also present. (Pitt-Rivers, Excavations IV (1898), 147-57; Arch. J., CXIX (1962), 54-56.)  (1)<NRHE site description>: A  bowl barrow on Handley Hill, listed by RCHME as Sixpenny Handley 37 and by Grinsell as Handley 24. Described by RCHME as a low mound circa 23 feet across surrounded by a small penannular ditch with a causeway on the south west side, it was excavated by Pitt Rivers in 1893. Beneath the mound were 3 hollows cut into the chalk. Pitt Rivers regarded two of them as empty graves. Their fillcontained a single small ox bone and a sherd of pottery. 8 further ""coarse"" sherds were found immediately above one of these features. Their date is unclear. They may be of Bronze Age date. However, a sherd of Neolithic Mortlake Ware was also found on the chalk surface beneath the mound. Subsequently the mound was the focus of a cremation cemetery. Burials - more than 50 in all - may have begun in the Early Bronze Age, judging by the presence of one associated with bone tweezers and covered by an inverted collared urn. The ovewhelming majority of asociations were, however, with Deverel-Rimbury vessels. One was also associated with fragments of twisted bronze. Unburnt animal bones were present in six of the cremations. Most of the cremations were deposited outside the ditch to the west, while a smaller number were scattered to the south and east. During John Barrett and Richard Bradley's research programme focused on Cranborne Chase, the site was re-examined and the sequence and structure of burial activity analysed. In the process a series of radiocarbon dates were obtained on surviving charcoal samples from Pitt Rivers excavations. However, all dates were obtained during a period when the British Museum's radiocarbon dating results incorporated a systematic error. Only one sample was subsequenely available for re-dating, some charcoal from one of the cremations deposits. The date obtained simply confirms the Middle Bronze Age date of the cremation deposit.",http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDO6085&resourceID=1012,,,47,,48,HER_Dorset,MonUID,MDO6085,PrefRef,3 020 037 A,NRHE,HOBUID,1312842,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x43093,https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=1312842,,,,1

Excavation of the remains (sited to SY69693346) from Woodwrd's plan) showed that the burial laid within a shallow subrectangular pit with remains of two beakers and a small bronze awl. The site had been badly eroded by ploughing, but it was shown that only one individual was present, probably male, and originally flexed with the head to the west. There was no sign of a perimeter ditch around the burial pit, but it is possible that it was originally protected by a burial mound and may therefore be the site of a ploughed out barrow. The Rimbury urnfield was also probably located within a barrow cemetery. The loss of barrows on this ridge outside the hillfort may be explained by its location within the Mediaeval open fields of Bincombe and Sutton Poyntz. These burial sites, together with the tumuli at Chalbury hillfort, (SY68SE33) can be considered to be southern outliers to the extended cemetery of the South Dorset Ridgeway.

(5) Monument Periods And Types.'The site of a round barrow known as Crouch Hill, located on Stanpit Marsh, was excavated by Harold St George Gray in 1921-22. In 1969 further excavation was undertaken by M Ridley. At the time of Gray's excavation, the mound was 48 metres in diameter and 1.6 metres high. No ditch was encountered in either excavation. The mound largely comprised sand, clay and turf, but had suffered severely from rabbit burrows. Because of the amount of 19th century material recovered, Gray was convinced that the mound was of modern origin, despite the quantity of prehistoric material also present within and beneath the mound. Ridley's 1969 excavation was never published, but an account of his work and a description of the finds from his and Gray's trenches was published by Cunliffe et al (1987). Gray had believed much of the pottery he found to be Bronze Age urn sherds, and although some were indeed Early Bronze Age, most were of Grooved Ware. Many of the sherds appeared as discrete deposits, some associated with flint implements. The pottery also appeared to have been deposited as sherds rather than complete vessels. A large burnt patch encountered by Gray comprised blackened sand and charcoal, with further sherds mixed in. Some small fragments of burnt material may have been bone, but Gray was unsure about their identification. (6) The 1969 excavation recovered further flints and Grooved Ware, and an almost complete inverted collared urn containing the cremated remains of a child. Large quantities of burnt flint were also found. Field-walking in 1984 across the site recovered large quantities of burnt flint, struck flakes and scrapers from the surface of the mound. Ridley also referred to the discovery of an amber bead and artefacts of Mesolithic to Bronze Age date.'

The ring-ditch measured about 28m in diameter and was 0.75m deep with near vertical sides and a flat base. The chalk surface within the ring ditch survived 160mm higher than the external chalk level. This has been interpreted as a protected surface formerly covered by a barrow mound. The shape of the protected chalk surface suggests this was a bell barrow.Four clusters of intersecting pits were spaced around the outer edge of the ring-ditch. These were subcircular to ovoid in plan, bowl-shaped profile and up to 2m across and 0.75m deep. Two pits in the west cluster cut the chalk rubble fills of the ring-ditch. They were generally filled with chalk rubble with secondary fills above similar to those from the ring-ditch. Fairly large quantities of Bronze Age flint were found in these pit clusters, but was particularly concentrated in the north cluster. These pits are thought to have provided additional material for recovering or re-emphasising the barrow mound, perhaps indicating the application of a fresh covering of white chalk. The date of this activity is not known.This monument is dated by the early 2nd millennium BC radiocarbon date from the central burial (2130-1710 cal BC at 2 sigma: HAR-9159). The finds from the ring-ditch and quarry pits confirm the Bronze Age date for this monument. The ring- ditch contained  a very large quantity of worked Bronze Age flint, a small quantity of Bronze Age grog tempered pottery and some animal bone.

The numbers in square brackets below refer to the context and feature numbers used in the published report (1).Bronze Age double Ring-Ditch [2300] was located in the SW corner of the main site. It comprised a pair of contiguous penannular ditches, forming a double or bi-lobate enclosure with a central causeway on the north side. The eastern ditch [1600] was the larger and surrounded a slight circular structure [1100] set almost centrally within it. The eastern ditch [1600] cut through the secondary fills of the southern ditch [1998] of the long barrow [2000]. There were no other stratigraphic links with major landscape features on the site, although the same ditch [1600] was cut by a Durotrigian [1138] and a late Roman [1144] burial. It seems to have been respected by later boundary features up to the late Roman period , suggesting that it survived as an earthwork until that time at least. The two ditches making up the monument [1600] & [2350] abutted each other on the south side in what appeared to be a deliberate and contemporary manner, though on the north side a 2.5m causeway remained between the two terminals. The ditches appear to have been cut as a continuous single structure with no re-cuts or cleaning episodes.  The eastern ditch [1600] had an external diameter of c.37m and the western ditch [2350] had a diameter of c.30m. they both had regular steep-sided, flat based profiles along the whole of their length, reminiscent of the bipartite ring ditch further east. The depth of the ditch varied from 1m to 1.2m with a distinct step of c. 0.1m down to the base of the western ditch [2350].  The fills suggested that there may have been an external bank accompanying the ditch.There was no artefact dating evidence for the deposition of the fills but they were cut by three graves [127], [1582] & [3907], containing inhumation burials, one of which was submitted for radiocarbon dating, suggesting that by 2580-1920 cal BC the enclosure ditches were at least half filled up.The marked difference between the two areas enclosed by the two ditches was the presence within [1600] of a circular timber setting [1100], set slightly south of centre and  two Middle-Late Iron Age pit burials. Structure [1100] was 10.5m in diameter and formed by a series of stake holes linked together by a narrow, shallow trench. There were three apparent gaps in the circuit, although they may have been caused by erosion or damage. That the gaps were original however was suggested by their distribution on the NE, NW & SW sides, similar to that of the burials in ditch [1600]. The only finds from structure [1100] were a few very fragmentary animal bones.The ground plan of the monument is similar to that of a ditched double round barrow examples of which occur on the South Dorset Ridgeway. The circular stake structure [1100] may represent some form of funerary structure within which burials were placed, directly on to the ground surface, immediately prior to the construction of the mound. The three burials in ditch [1600] can be regarded as secondary burials, all inserted into secondary fills of the ditch. The late 3rd millennium date from burial [127] suggests that the Alington Avenue double barrow may be one of the earliest barrows on the Alington ridge",http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MDO18524&resourceID=1012,70353,5,2,5,2,HER_Dorset,MonUID,MDO18524,PrefRef,MDO18524,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x41949,,,,,1

No other burials were noted however, suggesting a small isolated group [2].<NRHE description>: Inhumations found in 1884 by Thomas Hardy, during building excavations for his house, Max Gate (70448991), about 1/2 mile S.E. of the Roman town. Of three burials apparently close together in 'elliptical' graves 4 ft by 2 1/2 ft., cut vertically in the Chalk, with heads W., E., and probably S.W., at least two were contracted on their right sides with hands touching the ankles. One of the latter had a bronze fibula on the skull between forehead and crown, probably securing a shroud, a flask by the breast, and two similar black or 'grey ware' urns touching the shins, with a half only of another urn beside them. The other had four vessels by the breast, also nearly upright but touching each other; two were of 'ordinary' size, two small. The burial less completely known to Hardy had 'two other urns of like description', and, it would seem, a second fibula. Two yards S. of these graves a circular pit, 2 ft. by 5 ft. deep, packed with flints, had a flagstone at bottom and above it an ox horn, with ox bones and teeth and pieces of bitumous matter. Some tile, Roman brick and glass were found in the area. Of many other skeletons, some were extended, some on their sides, with no consistent orientation. A large stone, 'set up at Max Gate as a menhir', covered one; from the brow of another Hardy took two bronze penannular brooches linked by an elaborately decorated bronze fibula of 'Maiden Castle' type with iron hinge-pin.A large pit contained remains of a horse, much ash, and an iron spear-head. The ring-neck flask of cream-coloured ware is comparable with Claudian examples form the Corfe Mullen kiln, but it may well have been prized for a generation or more before its consignment to the grave.The six black ware vessels preserved from the site are of early types not necessrily later than the 1st century A.D. These are bowls of Durotrigian classes 1, 1a, and 2; one is a globular Durotrigian bowl.

These were not under a slab but a large sarsen fragment was found one metre away. This stone measured 610x250x110mm across. It was broken up during excavation and a small part of it was retained in the archive.",2788,"A probably circular enclosure partly revealed by excavation at Flagstones by Wessex Archaeology in 1987-1988 in advance of the construction of the Dorchester By-pass and further parts by geophysical survey in 1992. The excavated area included slightly over half of the enclosure circuit and a further small part of the northeastern side was revealed by geophysical survey. The full circuit has not been determined.The following description is abstracted from the final published report on the site (1). The numbers in square brackets refer to context numbers quoted in the report.The enclosure is about 100m in diameter and is defined by a single discontinuous circuit of ovoid pits [00399], some of them intercutting. The segments were unevenly spaced with many intercutting pits in the northwest and southwest parts of the excavated circuit and with causeways generally 0.5-2.5m wide between pits elsewhere. There were two wider gaps in the circuit to the north and to the west, perhaps denoting entrances. A total of 39 segments were exposed by the excavation and these were generally between 1.3-3m wide, 2-5.75m long and 0.75-1.4m deep with steep, almost vertical, sides and flat bottoms. The two pits (segments 35 & 36) each side of the wide gap in the north side of the circuit were very shallow with bowl-shaped profiles. The location of four further pits was found by geophysical survey in the area behind Max Gate House. Shallow engravings were found in four of the pits in the north, northwest, south and southwest parts of the circuit (segments 4, 12, 28, 34). These engravings comprised series of curvilinear lines, criss-cross patterns or more complex shapes (2). In common with many other features at Flagstones, there was a large amount of intrusive material found in this monument, largely a result of considerable root and animal disturbance.Primary burials were placed on the base of three segments. The cremated remains of an adult beneath a large sarsen slab were found in segment 16 in the west. Close by in segment 19 were the remains of a child inhumation beneath a large slab of calcareous sandstone. In the west terminal of segment 30 in the north was the crushed skeleton on a 6-12 month old child and the femur of a 3-5 year old. These were not under a slab but a large sarsen fragment was found nearby. Three radiocarbon dates were obtained from human bone and antler from the base of the pits gave a late 4th millenium BC date.Most of the segments appear to have filled rapidly and naturally with vacuous chalk rubble containing few finds. These included some earlier Neolithic bowl sherds, worked flint, 5 antler picks, a chalk ball, and a number of fragments of sarsen, limestone and sandstone with fresh breaks and some with signs of burning. The right femur of an adult was also recovered from the primary fill. Animal bone was mainly red deer with some cattle and dog bone. A pit was cut into the primary fills of segment 14 for the burial of a 10-12 year old child inhumation. A late 3rd millenium BC radiocarbon date was obtained from this skeleton.

There are 7 14C dates too.This is one of 2 ring cairns set within hillslope of larger ritual and funerary landscape that also includes stone circles and standing stones. This one contained cremations and Collared Urns and Food Vessels. This is Moel Goedog 1A series of shallow pits and hollows - a total of 10- were excavated inside the ring cairn which was c. 7.6m in diameter. Some contained only charcoal (mainly oak) - a total of 6 did this. Pyre debris or pyre site - one pit also had burnt clay so possibly was a pyre. The other 4 contained cremated bone and pots - mainly token cremations. One Enlarged Food Vessel and two Collared Urns; all were found inverted in the pits. Only two of these were associated with cremated human bone. One cremation was unurned.,867,"One of the stone circles has seven remaining stones standing to a height between 9 -21 inches, with the other stones around the 20ft diameter of the circle prostrate, including the largest of the group at over 4ft long. The second 20ft diameter, western circle is less well defined with all but 3 of the stones lying prostrate or out of the circle and a large gap on the east side. <1>28 yards in circumference, this circle is one of a pair of cairn circles. The former has only about 8 stones around it, the biggest of which is a thin slab projecting 2ft above the ground. <2>(Unpublished 1977) The site is set on a small hillside amongst scattered gorse hummocks and boulders and consequently is not particularly easy to recognise. One prominent upright stone stands on the western perimeter and seven or eight  smaller stones and slabs, some leaning inwards as if partly collapsed, are ranged in a ring about 7.50m in diameter. The centre is grass grown and fairly level. Outside the circle proper the ground slopes away, but on the north side the tips of the stones protruding above the grass hint at further features, possibly a stone bank behind the uprights on the lower side. The monument has not been planned in modern times.The condition of the western circle, March 1978: The monument has been traversed by hymac (mechanical excavator) and nearly all the stones pulled out. These are scattered over the site together with some boulders which probably do not belong to the monument. The area has been ploughed. The result is that there are a number of shallow scoops (most are 5-10 cm deep) some of which may have been the settings of stones, others are where machine tracks have ripped up the turf. The main stones may be recognised with some degree of certainty but the stone holes are far from clear. Only one hole is of any depth (about 25cm) and the others consist of ill defined scoops with small stones loosened and scattered within them. By no means all these scoops contained stones. The suggested bank on the NE can still be recognized and a length of its outer edge is undamaged. With the exception of the machine tracks and stone holes (stippled on the plan) the site is still under grass. <4>Routine visit to this area revealed that some of the reinstated stones were in danger of toppling over through the action of sheep rubbing against them. <5>Excavation of Moel Goedog was made in the winter of 1978. The circle 6.5-7m in diameter originally consisted of 12 upright stones in deep holes, none more than 1m high, banked by an infill of cairn material circa 3m wide and 2 or 3 stones high. Only 3 of the upright stones remained, 4 had been pulled out in January 1978 and 5 lost many years ago, but these stone holes and packing survived. Within the central area were 9 pits, the varying levels of which suggest a long sequence of activity. Most of them contained dark earth and charcoal, one deposit contained a charred urn and another included an urn containing a quantity of cremated bones. The earliest feature was a deep pit containing a very large unfilled with charcoal and cremated bones. The upright stones were replaced and new stones found for the other post holes. The eastern circle (PRN 1009) was not investigated. <6>Impressive and well preserved monument, easily visible and complete despite previous excavation.

It comprised acircular enclosure ditch c.28.0m diameter, in the centre of which were found traces of a small cairncovering two human cremations in pots (Figure 5). The enclosure was unknown when the desktopassessments of the route of the road were carried out in 1993, 1996 and 1997 (GAT Report: 60, Project No. G1142; GAT Report: 224, Project No. G1429 and GAT Project No. G1513, respectively). The Royal Commission on Ancient and Historic Monuments, Wales first noted the site in 2004 as a crop mark on an aerial photograph. It was recorded as a cropmark of a sub-circular enclosure, in the region of 30m in diameter, having a rather flattened north-west face & giving indications of possible structures within; set on generally level, low-lying ground (RCAHMW NPRN 401,896, AP895046/10-11, 2004). The site was subsequently given a PRN by the Historic Environment Record: PRN 19659.The enclosure was not identified by the geophysical survey of the road assessment phase (GAT Project No. G1692; Stratascan Report Job Ref. 1899, August 2004). The field was excluded from survey as the new road here was to be simply an improvement of the line of the existing road and only a very narrow strip of the field was due to be affected.The enclosure ditch was discovered during the archaeological evaluation of Diversion 3 and wasidentified in Trench 7. At this stage there was little evidence from the enclosure to suggest its functionor date and it was hoped that further investigation within the proposed route of the road corridor would provide an answer (GAT Project No.: G1692; Report No.: 625). A larger area of 560 sq. m. (Trench 99) was excavated along the road improvement scheme, exposing the whole circumference of the enclosure ditch and revealing several pits and other features (Figure 5). The excavation results from Trench 99 are included in this report.Topographic location:The site lies at SH 44923772, on a fairly level slight natural terrace at the edge of an area of lowundulating land at the point where it dips in a gentle slope towards the coastal plain. This provides good views over the coast and a natural route above the marshy lowland that has long been utilised for a road and may well have been a route originating in prehistoric times. The subsoil is a silty fluvioglacial till and the soils of the area are rated as land capability Grade 2: moderate to good quality, suitable for intensive pasture with some arable (MAFF 1977, 1988).",https://www.archwilio.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GAT19659,,2,2,2,4,HER_Gwynedd,PRN,19659,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x41949,,,,,3

It sits in a commanding position on top of a ridge overlooking the Llyn Llywenan and the lands stretching to the Holy Island. It was already disturbed in 1870 by J Wynee Jones who found more than '1 inhumed body' and Frances Lynch says he also discovered a number of cremations. Human remains were enveloped in fibrous matts or flat wooden boards. The barrow did not cover any elaborate structure (eg kerb cairn) but there was a mass of cremated bones on the old ground surface and a large ribbed jet bead (similar to Bedd Branwen one). Note some of the pots did not contain or were not obviously associated directly with cremated bone - offerings?Bronze Age barrow near others in the vicinity<cenotaphs>,760,"Tumulus. <1>On arriving at Treiorwerth, the seat of the President, the visitors were received in the most cordial and hospitable manner.  During the day the excavation of a low tumulus had been going on, the result of which was the discovery of the remains of more than one inhumed body; a considerable quantity of pottery of various kinds, among which was some of substantial white ware, such as has been found in connexion with the cyttiau.  One portion was of a dark, drab colour, with patterns like the fern-leaf pattern, and chevrons surmounted with a narrow band of inclined lines.  These are not unusual patterns in early British pottery.  An ornamented bead - part of a necklace, in all probability - was picked up among the debris.  It is of a light and black substance something like jet. <2>Among the fragments of urns was one bearing a not unusual pattern of rather late kind, perhaps Romano British as the same pattern is frequently found in Brittany where it is considered to be Gallo Roman. Most important discovery was the finding of human remains so closely incorporated with a fibrous mass that the bones, which were easily distinguished, could not be separated. It was greasy to the touch and had a greasy unctuous appearance, nearly black and much darker than the soil out of which it was extricated. There were traces of neither wooden nor stone chests. <3>The cinery urn was presented to the British Museum. Various kinds of pottery and a dark coloured ornamental bead were in the possession of W. O. Stanley in 1875. Some pottery was of a substantial white-ware, thought to be roman-British 'mortaria' from Shropshire or imported from Gaul. <4>The barrow had been built as a simple cairn of large stones capped with a layer of orange/yellow clay which also filled the interstices of the cairn. It was 14.5m in diameter, the edge marked by largish stones laid flat. The cairn survived to a height of 75cm but would probably have been at least 1m originally. The centre of the barrow was entirely destroyed by the 1870 excavation and superficial disturbances were found elsewhere. An unurned cremation on the old ground surface just east of the central area, an enlarged food vessel inverted over charcoal and dark earth upright in the basal layer of the cairn at the eastern edge, suggest that the barrow was a multiple burial mound. In the eastern half four other cinerary urns were found dug into the clay capping. All except one was badly disturbed and were probably secondaries. No grave goods. Also dug into the clay capping were the inhumation cists (containing nothing because of the acidity of the soil). All had been built of thin upright stones, without a floor, but roofed by several capstones. The complete lack of finds makes it difficult to date them closely but it is possible that they belong to the roman period, a date supported by the finding of roman pottery in 1870. <5>",https://www.archwilio.org.uk/arch/query/page.php?watprn=GAT2084,,,2,6,4,HER_Gwynedd,PRN,2084,,,NMR_Wales,NPRN,302324,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x41949,https://coflein.gov.uk/en/site/302324/,,,4395,2
30015,Bedd Branwen,"Round Barrow, Llanddeusant",Gwynedd,Ynys Mon,Tref Alaw,ROUND BARROW,ROUND BARROW,Round Barrow,236111,384979,"Bedd Branwen round barrow takes its name from a Mabinogion tale.  Branwen, daughter of Llyr, died of a broken heart, regretting the trouble she had caused between Welsh and Irish warriors. She was buried beside the river Alaw.However the burial mound is far older than the Mabinogion.  The central stone was erected in the late 3rd millennium BC.  Radiocarbon dates indicate that the stone had stood for centuries as an independent monument before the burial mound was constructed around it in approximately 1400 BC.  This mound (barrow) formed a cemetery for up to 12 people, who are presumed to have been wealthy due to the pottery and grave goods recovered, which included imported beads, amber and carved jet.F. M. Lynch excavated the site in 1966 and demonstrated that the mound was of complex construction.  Long after the stone had been erected, 3 urns with cremated bones and accompanying grave goods were buried.  A wide ring of stone was built over the top.  Then the area between the stone ring and the centre was filled with stone to create a cone-shaped bank.  This was covered by the earthen mound, which extended out to a retaining kerb of boulders, some of which are still visible.After the construction of the mound, at least 4 other cremation burials of similar style - and therefore probably similar date - were inserted into it.  The arrangement of the burials and their personal belongings is interesting because not one person was given the central position in the mound.  They were placed in a ring around the centre.  This suggests equality despite the variations in personal wealth demonstrated by the goods accompanying each burial.  No one was buried with a dagger, as is common in contemporary sites elsewhere in Britain.Three smaller pots containing infant ear bones were buried alongside adults' urns. This curious practice has also been found on some other sites in Anglesey.http://www.coflein.gov.uk/en/site/302327/details/BEDD+BRANWEN+-+CAIRN+SOUTH-WEST+OF+GLANAL",2006,"Bedd Branwen. <1>In 1813 a cist was found in the centre containing an inverted EBA cinerary urn of enlarged food-vessel type with a cremation. It is probable, but not certain, that fragments of a beaker and the unburned bones of a young man came also from this cairn. The cremation was identified as a female, and site has been associated with the legendary square grave on the banks of the Alaw where Branwen was buried according to the Mabinogion. <2>The remains of a round cairn about 120 yards in circumference and about 3ft high, the upper part having been removed. In the centre is a stone split in half, and the other stones are lying about. Condition poor. (RCAHMW, 1937)The barrow has recently been excavated. It is a multiple cist cairn with a cairn ring and at least seven contemporary burials which, on the evidence of grave goods, can be dated 1550-1400 BC. There is a central standing stone. <4>Excavation Report. <5>The beaker from Bedd Branwen is a western funnel-necked variant of late southern type, now in the British Museum. <6> It has been assumed that Bedd Branwen was a Beaker Barrow, reused at a later period, and that both the primary and the secondary burials had been disturbed in 1813. However, recent large-scale excavation of the site failed to produce any evidence for a beaker burial and, moreover, it was clear that the entire barrow had been built at a date around 1400 BC contemporary with the urn burial. One must therefore conclude that the association of the Beaker and the urn was a mistake for which the chequered history of the urn between 1813 and 1834 gave ample opportunity. The mound is designed around the central stone, which must have existed as a monument in its own right. <7>The excavation of the bronze-age burial mound produced three leaf-shaped flakes of flint and one microlith. The four pieces occurred in the turf, of which the actual mound was composed, their incorporation in the mound may well have been accidental. <8>Samples associated with Bronze Age urns and other pottery from the excavation was subjected to Carbon 14 analysis. Charcoal from the central stone yielded a date of 4923 +/- 75 b.p. predating the construction of the barrow. <9>Bedd Branwen is a typical ring cairn covered by a barrow.

There was also a shallow pit inside Henge b with a crushed Beaker and carbonised wood but no evidence for any associated human remains and the pit was too small to have contained a (degraded) inhumation). Thus there was a great deal of ritual as well as funerary activity going on. 6 actual burials (all cremations) with grave goods or planks> ",1267,"Two henges and the U-shaped end of a cursus were discovered from the air at Llandegai, by Dr. J. K. St. Joseph in 1960. Excavations by C.

Henge A, nearly 90m in diameter, was bounded by a 9m wide ditch with a single narrow entrance causeway. Henge Bwas somewhat smaller with opposing entrances. Cremation burials were discovered in the vicinity of both henges. The morphology of henge A suggests that it was the earlier of the two. The Llandegai cursus (feature C) was first noted by K. St.Joseph (1961) during aerial reconnaissance. The cursus was found to consist of a parallel alignment of two 3m wide ditches linked together in a U-shaped terminus. This type of earthwork is most commonly found in Wessex and the Thames valley and is often found in association with henge monuments. The excavations did not only reveal ritual Neolithic remains. The ditch of Henge B cut through an array of rectangular post-holes probably representing the remains of two earlier buildings. Nearby rubbish pits confirmed the presence of domestic activity that could have been contemporary with the earlier Henge A.  (Hopewell and Davidson, 1999). This small monument was identified and completely excavated in 1966 and was situated west-southwest of the end of the cursus (Lynch & Musson 2001). It was roughly equidistant from the two main henges but lay south of the alignment between the cursus and Circle D. The two entrances were aligned northwest/southeast, in contrast to the two large henges (A and B) where, thought they are of different dates, both entrances faced almost due west. There is no dating evidence for the monument, but these two factors suggest that it is an addition to the prehistoric landscape, later than the cursus and Circle D and Henge B.The monument consisted of two curved ditches forming a circle 8m in diameter. The south ditch, 1.5m across and 0.48m deep, was slightly larger than that to the north. There was little indication of the position of any bank in the truncated ditch sections, but due to the lack of internal space, this may have been on the outside. There were no significant features within the 5.0m wide interior.The location of the hengiform monument is currently an access road belonging to the Wardle Storeys factory (Figure 1).

This is a large mound constructed of rounded stones originating from fluvio-glacial deposits.  Landowner stated that the stones are very closely and carefully packed together. Construction of a garden path, observed by GAT, exposed some boulders at the north side of the mound, certainly cairn material and possibly part of a kerb. The mound is now a garden and has been modified on its SE side where it is now revetted by a wall.  There has also been some loss of the mound near the house, to the N.  A vague linear hollow may represent an 1869 excavation trench.  The cairn is on the summit of a low rise and has excellent views, especially towards the hills to the S & E.  The view is blocked to the NW by a ridge.

Early activity on the site took the form of an earlier Bronze Age funerary and ceremonial complex consisting of a cremation cemetery and a timber circle. The later Iron Age and Romano-British settlement consists of several broadly contemporary roundhouses located alongside a pebble trackway (Figure 6.20). They are likely to be the result of a long phase of occupation which saw the renewal and reconstruction of the roundhouses. The site was relatively rich in finds and may have been of high status in the Romano-British period due to the amount of imported samian wares recovered. A large assemblage of pottery sherds alongside a collection of glass beads, a shale bracelet, a coin hoard of the late-third century AD, ceramic and lead spindle whorls and worked stone artefacts including rotary querns and mortars, dates this phase of occupation to the later first to mid-fourth centuries AD. An early medieval phase of occupation is also represented by the objects from the rubble contexts overlying the roundhouses, including a Byzantine intaglio, an early post-Roman penannular brooch and a sherd of D-ware platter  a rare imported ware from SW France (Roberts et al. 2004, 20). This suggests that the decayed dwellings were a focus for ephemeral occupation activities between the fifth and seventh centuries AD. The settlement is characterized by clusters of dwellings and pit clusters situated either side of the cobbled trackway (S10), which was nearly 4m wide and aligned northeastsouthwest. It was largely made from two compact layers of gravel and stone, which displayed evidence of wear. A possible contemporary ditched field system, aligned eastwest, was identified to the southeast of the settlement, alongside a small ditched enclosure (S7), interpreted as an animal pen (Roberts et al. 2004, 27).

Then came a 15in layer of black soil and stones in which was dispersed some human and animal bones, flint scrapers, and fragments of pottery. Below this was a 3in thick paving stone, below which was a 9in thick layer of black soil and small stones with bones, worked flints and fragments of pottery. At the bottom was a wet, stick soil containing a quantity of mussel shells. At a distance of about 6ft below the capstone, undisturbed soil was reached.The finds were 4 flint scrapers, flint flakes and pieces of flint; fragments of a coarse brown pottery with an incised design of zigzag lines; fragments of coarse black pottery; two fragments of ware, one piece of rim having a zigzag pattern; parts of 12 or more human jaws, a few of which later appeared to be identical to Eskimo jaw bones; and many fragments of skulls and bones, one of which was a foot bone of especial interest, being that of a six-toed individual; bones and teeth of a small ox, a sheep and a young pig; portions of the horns and bones of red and roe deer; the femur of a fox; the wing-bone of a fowl; and portions of an otter's skull.An opening was made in the soil just to the N of the cromlech and at a depth of 4ft was found black soil containing a quantity of human teeth and fragments of bone, a flint scraper, a bone pin 4 1/2ins long by 1/4in thick and pointed at one end, and some teeth of bos, pig, and dog. The soil extended only 3ft 6ins from the cromlech and suggested that an entry into the chamber may have been forced here. There is no record or tradition of the burials which have taken place here or as to the origin of this cromlech. <2>There is one feature about the arrangement of the uprights of this dolmen which appears to be exceptional. The SE supporter points almost exactly due E and on the opposite side is a flat slab pointing almost due W. On the S side, another flat slab, set at right angles to the wall of the chamber points toward the S, but movement of the capstone has shifted it slightly. These features point to an early age when some form of sun worship was practised as the equinoxes and the solstices can be ascertained by the alignment of these stones. Sir Norman Lockyer obtained a clock star alignment from an outlying stone in a neighbouring field, enabling him to suggest 1200 to 1000 BC as the date of the monuments execution. It is probable that a passage led up to the entrance and three stones found lying outside the chamber may have been used in its construction.

Surveyed at 1:2500. <2>The Tyddyn Bach round barrow is an exceptionally large, well-preserved and largely intact example of a burial monument of the Early Bronze Age (c. 2050-1500 BC). The monument is some 25m in diameter and 1.6m high and is unusual in a Welsh upland context in comprising a barrow of earth rather than the more usual cairn of stones. In 1873, human bones, a gold ring and a bronze spearhead were found in a box or ""cist"" underlying a standing stone at the centre of the mound. The spearhead dates to the Early Bronze Age (c. 2050 - 1700BC) and the site is one of the most important Welsh examples of a standing stone marking a burial of this period. The stone was one of only a handful of dated standing stones in Wales and is also one of the earliest. An electrotype replica of the spearhead is currently on display in the National Museum of Wales. <9>DescriptionA very large and widely spread mound.  Possibly it is a natural glacial mound into the top of which a burial and standing stone were inserted.  This is suggested by the size of the mound, the lack of any suggestion of a surrounding ditch and because the cist found in 1873 was clearly near the top of the mound as it was found during ploughing.  Also there is another similar but smaller mound in the next field to the east.  There is a shallow hollow on the east side which may be the old excavation trench.  There is no very likely former standing stone nearby.  The largest from the gate nearby was brought in living memory from the north side of the field.  The cist and finds were made by the tenant's father's great great grandfather!  Possibly some knowledge about the gold ring was withheld.

Stead list thirty separate sites together with their finds. <3> Arras: SE 930 413. this site consisted of a large La Tene cemetery having at least 100 small barrows each covering a single contracted or extended inhumation. The majority of these barrows were excavated between 1815 and 1817 by the Rev E.W Stillingfleet and a chariot-burial was discovered in a chalk-pit here in 1876. Continuous cultivation has so levelled the site that today only three barrows cab be detected under ideal conditions. In 1959 a proton magnetometer survey, followed by selective excavation was undertaken. Two square enclosures, each defined by a ditch and each originally having had a barrow in the centre were uncovered. The first was some 40'-42' square, with a ditch 6' 8"" wide and 3'-3' 6"" deep. A small sherd, possibly of Iron Age date, was found in the ditch silting. At the centre of the enclosure; a now very slight mound covered a disturbed grave, orientated north to south, containing skull fragments and an iron penannular brooch. To the south, the second enclosure ('B' at SE 9310 4116) was some 34'-36' square, with a ditch 6'-7' wide and 3'-4' deep. Excavation showed that any interment must have been on or above the old ground surface and long since removed. A third square enclosure (at 'C' SE 9281 4770) was excavated by the Yorkshire Antiquarian Club in May 1850. All barrows in this group have been totally ploughed out. Published survey (25"") revised. Listed by Challis and Harding under 'La Tene Burials'. <4>The 'King's Barrow', excavated by E.W. Stillingfleet and other in 1816-17, was approximately 26ft (7.8m) in diameter and covered a circular grave, 11-12ft (3.4-3.7m) in diameter by 18ins (45.7cm) deep. It contained a skeleton on its back, and, near the skull, the skulls of two pigs. On either side of the inhumation lay a horse on top of which rested a wheel. In the western half of the grave were two linch-pins, two harness loops, five terrets and two horse-bits. <5>",http://www.heritagegateway.org.uk/Gateway/Results_Single.aspx?uid=MHU254&resourceID=1043,40000,,25,,26,HER_Humber,MonUID,MHU254,PrefRef,254,British Museum,Accession No.,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x43401,http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=25884&plaA=25884-3-2,Appendix D.1/18,,,4

Mortimer (1906), p 144 Brown (1915) IV 805. 1866 Mortimer excavated Beacon Hill barrow, then 44' across and 1' high, standing in an elevated position. Near the centre of the barrow, only 6"" deep, he found a skull and parts of an arm bone. Close to the side of the skull was an iron spearhead with split socket, 11"" long, pointing westward. It therefore seems probable that the head was at the west end of the grave. A little further south were portions of two blades of a pair of iron shears, but most of the burial had been removed when the beacon was made (1588).

This structure was positioned centrally within an earlier henge. No detailed excavation report.,252,"<NHRE site description>: A circular enclosure at Paddock Hill, Thwing, originally identified as a cropmark site. Excavation was undertaken between 1973 and 1987 by T Manby, intitially under the assumption that the site was a henge. However, the excavations revealed a long and complex sequence of use of the site. The earliest activity was represented by some flints of Mesolithic date, including microliths, cores and flakes. Earlier Neolithic activity was also represented solely by artefacts, including flint arrowheads, scrapers and stone axes, plus some sherds of Peterborough Ware. The first major constructional phase occurred in the late Neolithic, when a henge comprising a circular ditch circa 60 metres in diameter with external chalk bank was created. Grooved Ware and Beaker sherds are among the finds associated with the henge, which featured opposed north-west and south-east entrances. The earlier Bronze Age is represented primarily by artefacts, including some flint implements and Food Vessel sherds. The site was extensively remodelled in the Later Bronze Age. The silted-up henge ditch was recut, and a central post circle constructed, 17 metres in diameter and surrounding a central pit containing an urned cremation. Artefacts and other debris of Mid-to-late Bronze Age were also present, including evidence for metalworking activity. Next, a more substantial enclosure was constructed comprising a ditch and internal rampart circa 115 metres in diameter, completely enclosing the earlier enclosure. The rampart featured timber revetment and was retained at its rear by a double row of posts. This enclosure also featured opposed entrances on the same alignment as the earlier henge. Roughly contemporary is a ring slot circa 25 metres in diameter, within and concentric to the earlier henge, and interpreted as a large timber building.

Crop marks of square and apparently circular barrows can now be identified within an area measuring nearly 500 yards by 400 yards (450 x 360 m) and others have been identified in the belt of woodland lying immediately to the N. The precise limits of the burial area cannot be determined from aerial photographic evidence owing to the poor quality of recorded crop-growths. Most barrows seem to be of reasonably large size (c.301 -401 ;  9-12 m) and are very densely packed. In at least one part of the cemetery there is some evidence of a regular arrangement of barrows in lines.

However, Sheppard provides further details about the objects and includes occasional titbits about their association with human remains. Separate graves are allocated where details about the relationship between an object and a body are given.Sheppard (1939, 42) also notes that: 'The other objects are various pieces of iron pyrites such as occur in the natural state in the chalk, and probably their appearance among the burials is purely accidental, though on the other hand, as Mortimer suggests, there is a possibility they may have been used for ""strike-a-lights"".

The wheels had been stacked leaning against the side of the grave, their decayed wooden naves and spokes replaced in clay. The pole and axle had been buried as a single T-shaped frame, 3.0m long and 2.2m across. The flexed corpse had been buried first and the framework of the vehicle lowered on top of it. The line of the yoke placed behind the body could be distinguished by a row of five terrets, the central one being finely decorated in relief. Alongside was a pair of linch pins and two horse pits; animal bones lay in front of and behind the shoulders of the body. A box shape, 1.7m by 1.0m, traced by darker filling above the skelton, may be the body of the chariot, upturned to cover it. Five smaller square barrows each had an unaccompanied north-south crouched burial in a large and deep grave. Four similar-sized barrows within ring ditches, two having causeways, had unusual features. The burials of males, one with a sword, another with a shield, all had iron spear or javelin heads thrust or thrown into the grave, 14 in that with a sword, and 11,7 and 3 in the others. Comparable finds have been made at Burton Fleming, Wetwang Slack and Grimthorpe. An enclosure 16-18m square with an entrance to the west is unique. No Iron Age grave was found within it but its centre was occupied by two rows of Anglian burials. Three other square barrows to the north-east, also had a western entrance and one had an extended east-west inhumation with a spearhead, but with an Anglian shield handle near the left hand. See also Current Archaeology 9 (1987), 234-7 and Anglo-Scandinavian Section. During excavations by I.M Stead thirty-five Anglian inhumation burials were discovered both at the centre of a large Iron Age enclosure, in three other Iron Age barrows, and elsewhere. Most were orientated east-west and grave goods indicate a 7th century date. A young child was accompanied by a fine gold pendant with filigree ornament, a silver toilet set, three silver rings and glass beads; a woman was buried with a brooch, pendant, bead and buckle, all of silver. A fine decorated hanging bowl had been missed by grave robbers. Other unusual graves included one with a bronze cauldron and support, and another with an iron ladle and a possible socketed weaving baton. Weapons were found in five graves and tools in two, knives came from eighteen and buckles from twelve graves. Bronze staples and iron fittings indicated wooden boxes or leather bags. Animal bones were found with twelve burials, usually at the feet. These burials were apparently an extension of Mortimer's Garton Gatehouse cemetery 500m to the east.

A depression in the centre of the mound summit attests to the fact that the barrow was excavated by J R Mortimer in 1870, who discovered the calcined bones of a child amongst some decayed wood ESE of the mound centre, about a metre from the mound base. This burial was made during the raising of the mound, following the primary interment.The primary interment was found cut into bedrock beneath the centre of the mound, and contained the remains of an extended male skeleton measuring 1.8 metres long, and orientated from head to feet, north west-south east.

National monument no 26540 <6> Bowl barrows, the most numerous form of round barrow, are funerary monuments  dating from the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age, with most examples belonging to the period 2400-1500 BC. They were constructed as earthen or rubble mounds, sometimes ditched, which covered single or multiple burials. They occur either in isolation or grouped as cemeteries and oftenacted as a focus for burials in later periods. Often superficially similar, although differing widely in size, they exhibit regional variations in form and a diversity of burial practices. There are over 10,000 surviving bowl barrows recorded nationally (many more have already been destroyed), occurring across most of lowland Britain. Often occupying prominent locations, they are a major historic element in the modern landscape and their considerable variation of form and longevity as a monument type provide important information on the diversity of beliefs and social organisations amongst early prehistoric communities. They are particularly representative of their period and a substantial proportion of surviving examples are considered worthy of protection. The monument is one of a closely associated group of barrows within and adjacent to the Towthorpe Plantation. The location of the modern county  boundary along this line of barrows offers important insight into the antiquity of land divisions in this region.

In 1980 John Dent had already taken aerial photographs of the area around Garton Station and Kirkburn, round and square barrows along with other cropmarks were visible on the aerial photographs. A large enclosure was identified through aerial photographs and geophysics so excavations were concentrated around this feature. In September 1987 two open area excavations (Site 1, 1900sqm and Site 2 2,2250sqm) were opened. The stripping of Site 1 uncovered a series of  square and round barrows. A cart burial with a later Anglian Burial were identified along with two smaller round barrows, an undated quarry, linear ditches and medieval furrows . The stripping of Site 2 uncovered  a larger oval enclosure, linear ditches, a Bronze Age crouched inhumation, an Iron Age square enclosure, round barrow and early Roman horse burials.

Centrally beneath the mound he found a subrectangular grave-pit orientated north-south and measuring 7 feet by 4.5 feet, and 3.5 feet deep. Silburn had emptied the southern half of the pit during his excavation, which seems to have involved digging a small hole down throught the approximate centre of the mound. The northern half had survived this process, and Mortimer found the legs of an adult inhumation, by the feet of which were the bones of a small child. In the disturbed southern half were human and animal bones left behind by Silburn, plus one of Silburn's commemmorative strips of lead bearing his name. Circa 2 feet east of the grave-pit and about 1 foot above the pre-mound surface was an inverted food vessel. Nothing was found with it.

Halfway along the centre line of the long barrow was a cremation in a shallow pit. Charcoal from the pit produced an Early Neolithic radiocarbon date.

Twelve large sarsen fragments survive although these have been badly damaged by collapse and erosion. The barrow was once an oblong burial chamber covered by a large mound. It was oriented East to West and blocked at both ends. There was a facade of four stones, two on each side of the east end. The chamber was covered by two capstones. It contained the cremated fragments of at least eleven adults and one infant. The remains included at least three pots all of Neolithic/Early Bronze Age fabric. The morphology of the tomb and grave-goods, suggest that it was in use in the Late Neolithic/Early Bronze Age (c. 1800-1400 B.C.). The barrow was still standing in the late 1st-2nd century A.D., when a small settlement sheltered in the lee of it and left a mass of pottery (some 900 sherds, iron nails, etc.) (see TQ 65 NE 14). The destruction of the tomb in the 12-13th centuries was apparently deliberate, probably during a search for treasure. The chamber was systematically turned over, pits were dug under the stones and the barrow was dug away. As a result of this the chamber collapsed, sealing medieval sherds beneath its stones (see TQ 65 NE 36). Since then the monument has been little disturbed. The tomb was erected in an area of extensive Mesolithic settlement which had long been known from surface collections but was now found stratified under the floor and wallstones [see also TQ 65 NE 15]The tomb was destroyed quite badly in the medieval period. The excavations recovered a quantity of Neolithic pottery from various contexts, as well as cremated human remains representing at least 12 individuals (over 4.800 fragments of cremated bone recovered) . The sequence and chronology of events at the tomb is difficult to disentangle because of the extent of the destruction and the acidic soils. The excavations also uncovered evidence for Early Bronze Age and Roman activity.Some of the cremations are likely EBA or even Beaker in date showing re-use over a long period of time. Twelve large sarsen fragments survive although badly damaged by collapse and erosion.  The majority of them was apparently still in their original positions although, like the Coldrum megalithic tomb, most of them had not been set in socket-holes.  The plan was an oblong chamber, oriented E.-W., blocked at both ends and having a facade of four stones, two on each side of the E. end.  The chamber, covered by two capstones, was about 12ft. x 8ft. x 7ft. high.  It contained the cremated fragments (some 4,800 were collected) of at least eleven adults and one infant.  The remains of a least three pots (50 fragments) also came from the chamber, one with fingernail impression,and all were of Neolithic/Early Bronze Age fabric.

The barrow was still standing in the late 1st-2nd century A.D., when a small settlement sheltered in the lee of it and left a mass of pottery (some 900 sherds, iron nails, etc.) (see TQ 65 NE 14). The destruction of the tomb in the 12-13th centuries was apparently deliberate, probably during a search for treasure.  The chamber was systematically turned over, pits were dug under the stones and the barrow was dug away.  As a result of this the chamber collapsed, sealing medieval sherds beneath its stones (see TQ 65 NE 36). Since then the monument has been little disturbed.  Some digging took place round the stones in the 18th-19th centuries and some of the smaller fragments may have been taken for roadmending, but the larger ones were untouched.

A 25"" survey has been carried out; see also GP's AO/59/56/6 - from S.E.; /7 from S.W. (7) Final excavation report. (8) Checked and correct. (9) From the National Heritage List for EnglandThe surviving remains of this monument lie on relatively low, sandy ground above the valley of a small stream. The remains are best interpreted as those of a Long Barrow oriented E- W with the burial chamber at the E end. Some 100m to the SE is the Addington Long Barrow. The most distinctive part of the monument is the cluster of large sarsen stones which originally formed a Neolithic burial chamber. The understanding of this monument relies heavily on the excavations carried out in 1957 by Dr. J. Alexander. These investigations demonstrated that the burial chamber had formerly been covered by a mound of sand 18m wide which nad been scraped up from the surrounding area.

A pennannular ditch with central cremation burial were found. The burial consisted of a Wessex biconical cremation urn containing ash. Such urns are typically more common in the Low Countries and may be seen as an indication of cross-Channel traffic at this period. It has since been dated to c.1300BC. The cremation pit was surrounded by four post holes indicating a small shelter/structure once covered it. An inhumation burial containing a male skeleton was found to the east of the cremation. Only one flaked flint was found in the grave.,663,"TQ 7245 6445 Due to the discovery of Romano-British pottery and Roman coins (TQ 76 SW 48) excavations were carried out on the summit of the North Downs ridge in Wouldham parish during the summer and autumn of 1982. The excavations uncovered a penannular V-shaped ditch with an average diameter of 13 m. In the centre of the area enclosed by the ditch was a circular pit 0.75 m in diameter and 0.38 m deep containing a Wessex biconical urn inverted over a cremation, probably a female between 20-45 years. The urn had been packed around with earth and was covered by a layer of flint nodules. Around the pit were four stake- holes, 0.07-0.08m in diameter and 0.15-0.20m deep, forming a rectangle. It is possible that this represents a stake structure which was constructed over the burial pit after the body was cremated. To the E of the central cremation was an oval pit capped with natural flints. This was 1.05 m  x  0.60m and 0.45 m deep containing an inhumation. The body, a male, about 19 years old, was in a contracted position, with its head to the N, lying on its right side facing W. The only object associated with the body was a naturally flaked flint on the pelvis. Within the central area were two shallow pits in the chalk which were covered with natural flints but only contained chalk backfill. The chalk surface SW and E of the central cremation producedsome slight depressions 0.03.0.05m deep which may represent the vestigal remains of former stake-holes. Outside the ditch a single well defined post-hole 0.2m in diameter was noted and a series of pits in the entrance area. A shallow scoop with flint capping about 30m N of the ditch entrance was identified by resistivity survey. Finds have been deposited in Rochester Museum. (1,2) The Wessex urn dates to c1300 BC and stands 18 inches high and has a decoration of three 'horseshoes'. Such urns, although found in this country, are more common in the Low Countries and are perhaps an indication of cross-Channel traffic at this period. One interesting small detail was that there were scorch marks on the inside of the urn, suggesting that the ashes were still hot when it was placed over them.

(4) A large tumulus on Mountain Hill, Cage Hill, Stowting was excavated by John Brent assisted by his brother Cecil Brent in the autumn of 1870. Near the surface of the mound he found portions of a British urn of reddish clay, ""slackly baked"" and evidently not in situ.  Small knobs projected under the rim of the vessel perforated by minute clear cut holes.  About 2ft beneath this ""what appeared to be a flint flake"" and the charred blade-bone of a sheep or pig were found upon an extensive floor of burnt wood ashes from 1-2 inches thick.  Excavation was continued down to the original ground level but no other finds were made.  After the excavations had commenced, Brent ascertained that the mound had been accidently ""explored"" about 30 years previously when taking off a portion of the top during agricultural improvements, and that some earthen vessels had been found.  Brent concluded that he may have missed any primary interment as the mound was very large and the agricultural improvements may, by altering its original outlines have rendered it uncertain where the true centre had once been. Identical information.    (5-7)From the National Heritage List for England:The monument, which is situated on a slight south-facing slope, includes a roughly circular burial mound and a surrounding ditch which has been completely infilled by erosion and recent agricultural activity. The mound measures some 31m in diameter and stands over 2m higher than the ground on the south side, although because of the sloping ground this measurement is reduced to 0.7m on the northern side. The surrounding ditch is visible only as a band of darker grass some 3m wide separated from the present foot of the mound by between 3 and 5m. The mound edge formerly abutted the surrounding ditch, but subsequent erosion and agricultural activity has reduced the dimensions of the mound slightly, separating it from its ditch. The ditch originally provided the soil with which the mound was constructed. The mound and the ditch together have a diameter of 47m. This was once a comparatively large burial mound. It was partially excavated in 1870 by John Brent, who found fragments of Bronze Age pottery and the remains of a funeral pyre at a depth of less than 1m. These are likely to have belonged to a secondary burial: Brent considered that he had failed to locate the primary burial owing to the alteration of the shape of the mound during soil improvement activities in the 1840s. More recent agricultural activities exposed several stone tools in the soil of the mound, suggesting that other secondary burials, accompanied by grave goods, had been placed in the upper parts of the mound.Bowl barrows, the most numerous form of round barrow, are funerary monuments dating from the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age, with most examples belonging to the period 2400-1500 BC. They were constructed as earthen or rubble mounds, sometimes ditched, which covered single or multiple burials. They occur either in isolation or grouped as cemeteries and often acted as a focus for burials in later periods. Often superficially similar, although differing widely in size, they exhibit regional variations in form and a diversity of burial practices. There are over 10,000 surviving bowl barrows recorded nationally (many more have already been destroyed), occurring across most of lowland Britain.

Detailed description of Faira bead.  (7) Additional bibliography.  (8,9)From the National Heritage List for England:DetailsThe monument includes a pair of bowl barrows each of which comprises an earthen mound encircled by a now-infilled quarry ditch. It also includes the area between the barrows which excavations on comparable sites have shown to be the location of further burials without covering mounds. The north-eastern example measures 17m in diameter and stands to a maximum height of 1.8m on the western side, diminishing to 0.5m on the eastern side as the ground level rises. There is no clear indication of the position of the ditch, which has been infilled by soil washed from the mound. Its near neighbour to the south-west has a slightly truncated mound measuring 19m NE-SW by 12m SE-NW and standing to 2.1m at its highest point. The oval shape is considered to be the result of changes caused by agricultural practices; the mound was originally circular. Like its neighbour, this example has no visible surrounding ditch, soil from the mound having filled it. Both of these barrows were partially excavated in 1872 by C. Woodruff and subsequently carefully reinstated. In the south-western mound were found four inverted pottery vessels containing ashes of cremated individuals as well as miniature pots and beads of blue glass-like material known as faience. Fragments of pottery were found in the north-eastern of the two mounds.Reasons for DesignationBowl barrows, the most numerous form of round barrow, are funerary monuments dating from the Late Neolithic period to the Late Bronze Age, with most examples belonging to the period 2400-1500 BC. They were constructed as earthen or rubble mounds, sometimes ditched, which covered single or multiple burials. They occur either in isolation or grouped as cemeteries and often acted as a focus for burials in later periods. Often superficially similar, although differing widely in size, they exhibit regional variations in form and a diversity of burial practices. There are over 10,000 surviving bowl barrows recorded nationally (many more have already been destroyed), occurring across most of lowland Britain. Often occupying prominent locations, they are a major historic element in the modern landscape and their considerable variation of form and longevity as a monument type provide important information on the diversity of beliefs and social organisations amongst early prehistoric communities. They are particularly representative of their period and a substantial proportion of surviving examples are considered worthy of protection.",http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/KCC.ExploringKentsPast.Web.Sites.Public/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MKE6643,,,4,5,4,HER_Kent,MonUID,MKE6643,PrefRef,TR 34 NE 12,NRHE,HOBUID,467376,n/a,https://www.pastscape.org.uk/hob.aspx?hob_id=467376&sort=2&type=BARROW&typeselect=c&rational=a&class1=None&period=None&county=95788&district=95870&parish=95887&place=&recordsperpage=10&source=text&rtype=&rnumber=#,,,4335,2

Associated with this were nine crouched prehistoric inhumations and nine Anglo-Saxon inhumations (see TR 36 NE 12). Further work in 1970-74, suggested there were in fact three Bronze Age barrows, including one with double concentric ditches and 11 prehistoric burials in total. A fourth barrow to the west was found in 2009.In 2015 part of the two concentric ring ditches of the multi-phase Bronze Age round barrow were exposed and sampled.<ggdb_summary>: Complex site, very partially published. Commenting on his own excavation of nine prehistoric burials associated with Barrow 1, Hurd (1911) notes that 'the absence of any objects being interred with the bones or what may be called grave “furniture” renders it difficult to assign an approximate date to them. Later assessments of a pottery vessel found in the mound assign it to the Early/Middle bronze Age (collared urn tending towards biconical urn) but Hurd makes clear that this was not directly associated with a burial. This vessel is in the British Museum <cenotaphs>. One of the graves from 1911 was accompanied by a flint flake and a strike-a-light, recorded here. Although the British Museum excavations in the 1970s focused on the early medieval cemetery, O'Brien (1999, 2) suggested that two of the excavated burials were Iron Age in date but neither were associated with grave goods. Excavations by Thanet Arch Trust identified two further prehistoric burials, one of which was associated with a ?collared urn pot. Full publication of this last excavation is awaited.",1605,"[TR 39456710]. In October 1911 at Valetta House, Broadstairs, 9 Late Bronze Age crouched burials were discovered around the inner of two concentric circular trenches, the larger about 82 ft. in diameter. Some questionable flint implements and a broken cinerary urn were also found. (1) Valetta House is now a school and there is no record of any subsequent discoveries.  The present whereabouts of the cinerary urn and the flint implements was not ascertained.  (2) Aerial photography has revealed the distinct ring ditch of a tumulus, within the ground of Bradstow School.  (3). Field Monument report (4). Further excavation work took place on the site between 1970-1974. See TR 36 NE 12. The work revealed a large Anglo saxon cemetery, sited around three Bronze Age barrows. It is also of note that the initial discovery of the Anglo-saxon cemetery in 1910, revealed two crouched burials of possible Bronze Age date (see 5). Evaluation work in 2003 at the school revealed the possible edge to a barrow ditch. As the feature was not dated during the evaluation, it is also possible that it may be the edge of a late chalk quarry. The feature recorded in the 2003 evaluation could be part of the eastern barrow. A total of eleven prehistoric burials have been associated with the three barrows as a result of the work in 1910, 1911 and 1970-74.  In a post medieval linear recorded during the evaluation two possible worked flints were also recorded (5). See also cropmark evidence from the area (TR 36 NE 226). A watching brief in 2004 re-observed the edge of the barrow or chalk quarry recorded during the evaluation. No new dating evidence was recovered, although the report does point out that if the feature is a chalk quarry pit, it is likely to have truncated away any the rest of the eastern barrow (6).In 2009 an evaluation was carried out on the proposed swimming pool site, to the west of the earlier discoveries. A ring ditch was found of a barrow c.19m in diameter. This brings the number of known Bronze Age barrows to four. (7)In 2009 the southern half of the fourth barrow was excavated by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology. The ring ditch was c.19m in diameter. The ditch had naturally silted over a long period. A layer of flints was found and disarticulated human remains were found within this. This deposit could indicate a clearance of the ditch, though not to its full original depth. The upper deposits of the ditch were filled with material derived from the ploughing down of the barrow, perhaps occurring from as early as the Iron Age. Two prehistoric graves were located, one within the area enclosed by the ditch and the other outside of it. The grave outside of the ring ditch was a crouched inhumation and poorly preserved. A vessel had been placed by the head of one. It is possible that one of the graves originally had some form of structure within it, that later decayed and collapsed. The second grave contained no surviving human remains but was of similar form to the first grave, and so was probably also a crouched inhumation. (8-9)In 2015 part of the two concentric ring ditches of the multi-phase Bronze Age round barrow were exposed and sampled during excavations by the Trust for Thanet Archaeology for a service trench. A platform between the outer and inner ring ditches was also exposed, suggesting deliberate emphaisis of the outer perimeter of the inner ditch. Evidence for a platform is currently limited to the exposed section within the service trench and easement. No evidence from previous excavation confirm whether the platform is present around the full perimeter of the ring ditch. It is noted that existing publications may present mis-plotted data as attemptems to reconcile existing drawn plans from previous work with the present georefereced survey demonstrate some major anomolies.

Both of these individuals were laid on their left-hand sides. Most of a food vessel pot was deposited very early on in the sequence (in Pit B) and was completely crushed upon excavation (possibly by the addition of Burial 2).

Given the complexities that exist regarding the stratigraphy of these burials, and the lack of clear correspondance between burials/pits they are all recorded here in one grave (Grave Pit 13). Grave goods are assigned to the relevant burials within the pit (based on info in Perkins 1994); separated dates are assigned to the C14 dated burials.

The inner ditch measured 11m diameter and was between 0.58m and 1.00m wide and survived between 0.16m and 0.32m deep.

This may have been for marking out the circuit of the ditch during initial construction, or for a central post marking the location of the mound. It is thought that the outer ditch of the barrow is a later addition, possibly associated with the secondary burial, and so representing a reuse of the earlier mound. The burial was C14 dated to 1620-1440 cal BC, a post-Beaker date. The barrow itself may then date to the Late Neolithic, given the apparent time that had passed between construction and the secondary burial, indicated by the level of silting within the original ditch.

It was paritally excavated on the northern edge of the site. The part exposed consists of two ditches which form a right angle. There are two entrances at the north-east and south-west corners. A concentration of pits within the enclosed area may relate to a period of occupation. A ditch is present, its function may have been for drainage, suggesting problems with flooding during the occupation on the site. Similar drainage ditches can be found on the opposite side of the river. The settlement is mid to late 1st century with pre-Flavian pottery. (1)An evaluation in 1992 and a subsequent excavation in 1993, both carried out by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, at Waterbrook Farm found a settlement clustered around the banks of a palaeochannel. Flooding of the settlement may have been a problem, several drainage ditches were present and canalising of the river before it was eventually infilled. The main period of occupation looks to be the late Iron Age, probably about 50 years before the Roman invasion, a date dedcued from recovered ceramics. Several rubbish pits were present on this site as well as one cremation.The archaeological features represented a short lived, though it was a continuously occupied native settlement. Ceramic evidence suggests that the site was enclosed in the late Iron Age and continued in use for c.150 yrs into the Roman period with occupation mostly situated on a low rise in the flood plain. The site lay adjacent to a relict channel of the East Stour, which probably once formed an oxbow encircling the settlement on 3 sides. The abrupt termination of the occupation in the 2nd century AD may have been due to the wetness of the site. (2)An evaluation in 1992 and a subsequent excavation in 1993, both carried out by Canterbury Archaeological Trust, at Waterbrook Farm found several cremations were found during the excavation. Three cremations were excavated, all crushed but with substantially complete pottery vessels dating to before AD 70 and were discovered in the base of two ditches. They appear to be simple cremation burial with the ditch, which is not uncommon. There is no burnt bone associated with but it may have degraded. Two more possible cremation burials in a similar state were found again in the base of a ditch. A heavily truncated cremation burial was situated in the south-eastern corner of an enclosure, though the two features may not be contemporary. The original cut for the burial was filled with a charcoal deposit, suggesting the pyre for the burning was situated nearby. The cut contained a number of fragments of burnt bone and sherds of a pottery vessel, which was a 1st to 2nd century 'Upchurch ware' bowl. A cinerary vessel may have been present but no longer exists and therefore of one were present it was biodegradable. This cremation was undated. There was one other possible cremation which was isolated and heavily truncated at the eastern edge of the site. It contained charcoal ash and burnt bone, which might have been an un-closed  cremation burial. Un-closed cremation burials are quite common in rural cemetries of Romano-British date, following a tradition of Iron Age cremations without containers.

The single deposit with human bone and a complete pot and the two bone deposits with amber beads are recorded here. The various deposits with burnt human bone and scraps of unburnt animal bone are not.",1329,"In 2009 an excavation was carried out at Margetts Pit by Wessex Archaeology. Evidence for Bronze Age to Late Iron Age/early Roman activity was found across the site. The earliest phase of activity was evidenced by flint working found as residual material in a number of later features. The quality and type suggest a Late Neolithic or Early Bronze Age date for this activity. Eight abraded and probably residual sherds of Beaker or Early Bronze Age pottery (two from Collared Urns) were found in later features. Middle Bronze Age activity was attested by a small assemblage of pottery consistent with Deverel-Rimbury traditions. This was mostly spread across the western part of the site, from the ditches of a rectilinear field system, 19 pits and/or post holes and two placed vessels. There was considerable overlap with Late Bronze Age areas of activity so it is not immediately clear which features were certainly Middle Bronze Age in date. The Middle Bronze Age pits contained flints (worked and burnt) and animal bones. The post holes did not form any obvious groups or structures. The two deposited vessels appeared to be closely associated with the field system ditches. The better preserved of the two contained animal bone and worked and burnt flint. Another 65 sherds from four or five separate vessels were found in a small cut but it is not clear if they too represent vessel deposition. The rectilinear field system was orientated approximately north-northwest to south-southeast. Surviving traces included shallow ditches in both the western and eastern parts of the site. Two parallel ditches 3.5m apart may be a trackway. The absence of such ditches from the centre of the site may be the result of truncation by later ploughing. Late Bronze Age pottery was found in the ditches but could indicate simply increased activity in this later period or long-term maintenance of the field system.The Late Bronze Age saw a considerable increase in activity on the site. Ditches were added to the Middle Bronze Age field system. Numerous pits were found across the site, these occurred in clusters, groups and as isolated features. Many of the pits contained apparent deposits of domestic rubbish   animal bone, pottery and worked flint. Some pits contained substantial deposits of shale-working waste, dating from later in the Late Bronze Age. In total nearly 10kg of shale was found, including bracelet blanks, roughouts at all stages of manufacture, broken finished pieces and debitage from working. This material was associated with Late Bronze Age pottery but also with Iron Age material, and the working may therefore have been occurring at the transition of the Late Bronze Age into the Iron Age. Other pits contained instances of structured deposition, such as one pit with a pair of large red deer antlers and an amber bead fragment. A sheep/goat was buried in one pit and a possibly lead miniature wheel-shaped object was found from the top of or just above an adjacent pit. Other partial-animal burials from the site dated to this period and it is possible that several other undated examples also did. Elsewhere, three Late Bronze Age vessels appeared to have been deliberately placed in the ground. Despite the number of pits and post holes, few clearly defined structures could be identified.

From the Middle Iron Age the site was the focus for a variety of activity types. The earliest phase of this occupation consisted of numerous shallow pits and/post holes. A number of larger pits, gullies and a hearth were also found. One gully may have related to a roundhouse. Two lengths of ditch were also found and are thought to perhaps represent the corner of a field. The site later developed with the laying out of a rectilinear enclosure and a stock funnel that fed into the enclosure. This fell out of use and was replaced by an east-west droveway. This route had regular gaps along its length, suggesting entrances to fields. Another trackway was established at this time going north-south across the site. The third phase of activity in the Late Iron Age/early Roman period saw another north-south route laid out across the site, on a slightly different alignment to the earlier one. This phase of activity also featured two burials. The first was a cremation in a pit accompanied by two fragmented vessels and two copper objects (initially described as 6 brooches and a copper alloy pestle and motar (1)). The vessels may have been deliberately broken prior to deposition. The pit was associated with a later post hole that may have served as a marker for the burial. An inhumation of an adult female was also found belonging to this period; the onlyaccompanying grave good with this burial was a copper alloy finger ring worn on the right hand.The Roman period proper featured a re-cutting of the southern part of the north-south routeway and the addition of a northwest-southeast route.

In addition to a number of early bronze age barrows and late bronze age enclosures (the 'northern', 'central', and 'southern' enclosures) a large mortuary features was discovered.  This was more than 45m long, 15m wide and up to 1.5m deep. It extended beyond the north-eastern limits of the excavation. It may have been initially used as a quarry but was, after a period of silting, used as a burial ground. The human remains found within the feature consisted of a combination of articulated remains, redeposited (manipulated) partial articulated remains, dispersed semi-articulated remains (whole corpse and body parts) and disarticulated bones and bone fragments. Six complete skeletons were found in the north part of the site, along with the articulated remains of a partial skeleton. Seven complete articulated skeletons were found in the southern part of the pit. Each skeleton was radiocarbon dated. The Late Bronze Age remains comprise a minimum of 24 individuals (including one cremation). The Early Iron Age remains were from seven individuals and the Middle Iron Age remains represented a minimum of eight individuals. There were 15 immature individuals and 23 adults but the immature examples were mostly teenagers with the youngest c.6 years old. Apart from during the Middle Iron Age, the individuals buried were more commonly female: during the Middle Iron Age, the distribution was equal. All four of the older adults were female. The remains were also subject to strontium/oxygen isotope analysis. This showed that some of the individuals were not of local origin, having migrated during childhood. Possible origins are in higher, colder and/or more easterly areas as well as warmer and/or more westerly areas. These patterns also varied between period. Origins in the high Alps, east or north of Britain (including Scandinavia) have been suggested but Scandinavia is the favoured likely point of origin for some of the individuals. Another group possibly came from the Mediterranean.The mortuary rite performed at the site is unusual in a number of ways. The assemblage represents a large number of individuals for these periods. A review in 1995 found only nine Late Bronze Age inhumation sites in mainland Britain. This number has increased since the time of the survey but they remain rare. Known examples of Early-Middle Iron Age burials are rarer still. The group is unusual for their age, sex and geographical origins, a feature that was maintained over the extended lifetime of the burial feature. Particular practices from the site are especially unusual. There is evidence of burial of unburnt remains with subsequent manipulation, communal and individual graves, human and probably animal sacrifice, excarnation with manipulation and redeposition of partially articulated body parts and curation of individual skeletal elements, exposure with canid and possibly avian scavenging and bleaching and charring of some body parts. Most of these occurred during the Late Bronze Age, with manipulation particularly common in this phase of use. One burial in particular appears to have been the focus of activity. An elderly female had been killed probably with a sword by blows to the back of the head. It has been suggested that this was a willing sacrifice. She was laid out in the bottom of the pit with a piece of chalk against her face in her left hand whilst her right hand was positioned with the index finger pointing away from the body towards the centre of the adjacent central enclosure on the site. Two children and a teenage girl had been buried with her together with the partially articulated and re-arranged remains of an adult male.",http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/KCC.ExploringKentsPast.Web.Sites.Public/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MKE90479,70334,,2,31,5,HER_Kent,MonUID,MKE90479,PrefRef,TR 36 SW 282,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,,2

Together with the occasional sherd from elsewhere along the route, particularly on Sites B and F, this does suggest a greater presence in the landscape than indicated by the discoveries along the CTRL, but only assessment will reveal the overall scales of that presence. Detailed information on the activities represented by the pit will have to await post-excavation assessment and analysis.Early Bronze Age activity is represented only by the one pit and by residual flint and a sherd. The duration of activity is therefore not likely to be very great, although it remains to be seen whether the Beaker burials and the Beaker pit are broadly contemporary, or date from different parts of the Beaker period, which spans at least 500 years.

Later ditches and structures were dated to the period 75 to 25 BC (Period IV in report), with scant evidence in area 3, suggesting the possibility of a high status settlement lying beyond the site boundary to the south west. Occupation during the very Late Iron Age/very Early Roman, dated 75 BC to AD 55, (referred to as 'Period V' in the report) saw an expansion of the site, with development south of the axial ditch [3276]. Features from this period included ditches (believed to form several enclosures, with a trackway as their locus), several pits and post-holes, several structures (believed to be dwellings or occupation sites, indicating continued development of this part of the site), spreads, two weapon burials, enclosures, pyre site or hearth and a well/shaft. Eleven pieces of glass were also recovered from area 4, all Late Iron Age or Roman in date. At least 15 special 'burial features' or deposits and other features associated with cremation including at least one pyre site were found.Weapon Burials:The most significant finds at the site were two weapon burials, deemed to be of national importance. Only nine weapon burials have been found previously in England south of the Humber, however, both sets of remains are in poor condition due to acidic Weald clay, which has led to significant deterioration. The first burial - [B20]- comprises a male inhumation (believed to be between 18 and 22 years of age) buried with weapons and one pot within a square-ditched enclosure, forming a pair with another burial -[B19]- 5m to the east. [B20] is dated to c.AD 10 via ceramics found in the grave fill. The two burials are placed within a zone of Middle/Late Iron Age settlement to the north and areas of Late Iron Age occupation and ritual activity to the south. Grave goods found alongside [B20] included a long sword and shield. Outside the 'coffin' a spear head was found lodged in the south-east wall of the grave, in addition to a Gallo-Belgic butt beaker (dated 10 BC to AD 10) and a circular ring of bronze. Found close by in a filled in ditch were broken whole pots and cattle jaws.Burial [B19] has been dated AD 30 to 50, presumed later than [B20] and shallow in depth, at ~400 to 450mm deep (at estimated Late Iron Age/Roman land surface). The accompanying grave goods were a butt beaker (AD 30 to 70), a terra negra platter with stamp [CANICOS -SN-], produced in Marne AD 20/25 to 40/45, and a small carinated cup or bowl (AD 0 to 50). With the body were a long sword with three suspension rings, a spear, a conical shield boss, a series of five iron objects lying across the line of the ankles, a single brooch on the chest and half a pigs head lying over the groin. The association of a weapon burial with a brooch and three pots is unique in Britain.Roman features at the site, dating AD 50 to 70 (Period VIa) comprised several ditches, pits, post-holes, kiln/pit and burial [B19] and [B20] enclosure ditches filling a 'ritual' enclosure ditch. During the latter period c.AD 70 to 120 (Period VIb) further ditches, pits, post-holes and a beam slot were identified. Mid Roman features -c.AD 120 to 200- comprised a trackway ditch.

At a later date, it was expanded. Most of the burials was then made into or on this mound. Again at a later date, the mound was further enlarged. It was almost completely buried in alluvium sometime around the Late Bronze Age or Early Iron Age. At this point, the bank was enlarged, perhaps to make the mound more prominent, and further burials were inserted into the alluvial deposits.

The fieldwork has generated a large body of archaeological data representing c. 2000 years of human activity, dating primarially from the Late Neolithic to the Roman periods.  The results, although not totally conclusive, have been obtained by means of a thorough stratigraphic analysis of the site, despite the poor survival of much of the archaeology, including evidence for the truncation of features and of significant post-depositional disturbance.  These problems were compounded by the fragmented nature of the associated pottery and the low pottery sherd count for most of the non-burial pottery assemblages. (see appendices 12.2 and 12.3).Zone A, which was predominantly Roman in date, contained evidence of both settlement activity (salt-making?) and cremation burial features.  Zone B, containing only cremation burial features, was also predominantly Roman in date.  Likewise, Zone C was predominantly Roman and with the exception of one feature contained only cremation burial features.  Settlement features excavated in Zone D1 were mostly undated but possibly of Iron Age date.  Zone D2 was negative in terms of archaeology. Zone D3 contained an area of intensive multi-phase settlement activity focused on the Middle to Late Iron Age. Zone D4 was also predominantly Roman in date but also contained a high level of prehistoric activity and evidence of disturbance.The results suggest that both the Prehistoric and Roman activity (including the cremation burial activity) was focused on areas of higher ground.  This is generally the norm for the later Prehistoric period, particularly from the Middle Iron Age when hillforts become more common.  Roman activity and cremation burials on the other hand, are not usually confined to higher ground.  Another dissimilarity is the lack of associated Roman inhumation burials at the site - in east Kent a localised tradition of inhumation burials has been observed alongside the cremation rite. (East Sussex C.C. et al 2007)The ephemeral prehistoric and Roman settlement/salt-making activity on the A249 Iwade bypass was confined to the lower ground in Zone A, close to the edge of the marsh.  No further evidence was found for Late Iron Age (or other) features recorded by the Stage 4 evaluation trenches at the northern extent of Zone A, south of Cowstead roundabout.  Similarly, in contrast to the results of the initial desk based assessment and Stage 2 survey, virtually no evidence was found for Medieval or Post-Medieval activity anywhere across the stripped area of the road scheme.Evidence of small scale Early - Middle Bronze Age activity across the site was recorded by the current flint assessment (see Appendix 12.1). This was not confirmed by the results of the prehistoric pottery assessment however, which, with the exception of a small number of possible Middle or Late Bronze Age sherds, found no secure evidence of activity between the Early Bronze Age and the Middle Bronze Age.  The bulk of the prehistoric pottery was dated to the latter period.  The prehistoric pottery assessment suggested a similarity of forms with assemblages found north of the Thames, as opposed to further west; but also found similarities with Essex in terms of adopted decoration of pottery vessels.",http://webapps.kent.gov.uk/KCC.ExploringKentsPast.Web.Sites.Public/SingleResult.aspx?uid=MKE39963,,,1,,1,HER_Kent,MonUID,MKE39963,PrefRef,TQ 97 SW 410,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,,1

Excavations by Orkney College  revealed under mound complex of central cists (not excavated this season) and a secondary box cist (c0.8 x 0.5 x 0.54m internally) of more typical Bronze Age type. This was the only cist to be investigated and contained a disturbed cremation burial and un-burnt human bone. A decorated rim sherd from a Bronze Age Food Vessel was also recovered.,484,"ND 3405 8905 Excavations from 20?30 June 2011 concluded work on this large (c11.5m wide by 1.2m high) burial mound. The established trench was extended to the E, to further investigate the partly excavated central stone-lined cist, and to expose the edge of the large central area to the N that was defined by substantial orthostats. This rubble-filled depression was previously thought to represent a large disturbed central cist.Excavations this season revealed that the first phase of the monument consisted of a small stalled Neolithic tomb measuring c3 x 2m internally with six large orthostats forming two opposing pairs of stalls. The tomb was aligned NE?SW with an entrance to the NE (unexcavated). The concentric external stone revetment walls exposed during previous seasons formed the outside of the tomb (c10m in diameter). The large central depression that was partly excavated last season (DES 2010, 132?3) turned out to be the robbed remains of the NW cell, although the inner wall had been removed. The tomb was not fully excavated, this stall was the only part to be investigated to floor level, and no human remains were recovered. A possible posthole was discovered below the robbed internal wall line, perhaps representing a construction marker, and charcoal was recovered for dating. Several cists were inserted into the mound when the Neolithic tomb was backfilled. The cists contained cremation burials and probably date to the Bronze Age. A third cist (c0.80 x 0.49 x 0.62m), which had been inserted into the top of the backfilled tomb entrance, was discovered this season. The cist had previously been disturbed and there was no evidence of a cremation burial. Unburnt human bone was found within the loose backfill, but this could have been incorporated during disturbance.The key discovery this season was the remains of an inhumation burial in the central cist. This relates to the substantial stone constructed square barrow that was built into the mound (DES 2009, 2010). The insertion of this cist involved removing and breaking several large orthostats and cutting into the backfilled Neolithic tomb. The central inhumation had been disturbed, most likely by antiquarians, and only the hands and feet remained in situ. The body was crouched and laid on the left side. The remains of a ?juvenile inhumation, also crouched and placed on the left side, was found outside the central cist to the NE, within a layer of rubble. The unburnt human bone found across the mound, especially in the N cist and around the central cist, was probably derived from these disturbed burials. The remains of the neonate burials found in 2009 to the SW of the central cist could also date to this phase (DES 2009, 141?2). These burial rites and the square barrow architecture suggest that this phase of the monument dates to the Iron Age and possibly the first few centuries AD. The 2011 excavations have confirmed the long history of construction and burial at Roeberry Barrow from the Neolithic to Iron Age, and portray the monument as a significant place for the communities at Cantick for several millennia.Archive: ORCA (currently)Funder: Orkney Islands Council, Scapa Flow Landscape Partnership (HLF) and ORCAORCA, 2011",http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/9444/,60005,,1,4,2,CANMORE,NUMLINK,9444,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,4876,7

Varme Dale is a dispersed scheduled collection of six mounds and barrows and the visit focused on an unscheduled outlier mound at HY 40716 18792 added to the group from a 1981 account (HY41NW 2), and the highest altitude mound at 49m OD. A second smaller outlier mound, c3.5m wide by 0.3m high was noted c18m W of the first at HY 40699 18786.The various clusters of monuments are almost certainly parts of general Bronze Age activity planned to exploit the extensive panoramic outlooks across the Bay of Firth. The modern nomenclature and protective zoning tends to artificially divide the traces into segments which underplay the full spread. At a detailed level, there are differences in recognisable size, the probable content of contained cists and maybe variations in construction, but the overall pattern is a series of low earth burial mounds, 5?15m in diameter and 0.3?2.0m high. The RCAHMS records suggest Verme Dale has at least seven recognisable mounds, whilst nearby Knowes of Euro has two mounds, and West Puldrite four mounds. This gives a total of at least 13 surviving mounds, and has increased significance when the full group is viewed as a single landscape phenomenon, which may originally have contained many more elements within its zonal spread.The various hillslopes around the Bay of Firth have a very high distribution of Bronze Age mounds and tumuli and this specific Enyas hillslope gives an unexpected sightline beyond the encircling horizons to the hills of Hoy through the Finstown gap. It seems very probable that this view was a selection factor for their location, as this landscape window is only available from a restricted portion of the hillside.David Lynn, 2012",http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/2423/,60013,,1,3,2,CANMORE,NUMLINK,2423,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,5229,6

Each of the large cairns contained a central, slab-built cist. Burnt deposits with bone inclusions underlay the basal slabs of both cists. The miniature cairn covered a pit which also contained burnt deposits. The cremated remains from the two larger cairns appear to represent a single adult in each case. Faunal remains from Cairn I include bones of a range of mammals, birds and fish. radiocarbon dates indicate that the cairns were built in the mid-to late second millennium BC.At Bu Farm, the evidence from the two cairns suggests that the remains of the individuals' bodies had different histories prior to being cremated. The bones of the individual in Cairn 1 were fleshless or dry when exposed, while the  corresponding signs were absent from the bones in Cairn 2 (McSweeney 1996, 113). Both cremation deposits were very light and comprised in each case less than half of the expected weight of a full cremation. The charcoal analysis at Cairn I identified calcium carbonate deposits on the charcoal which could been derived from dissolved bone.This is for cairn 1 as only 14C dates for burials here indicate a Bronze Age date.

Nether Mousland is a large deserted farmstead (HY21SW 26) with an additional dwelling (HY21SW 27) and surrounding sub-circular head dyke. This coastal basin landscape had previously received little archaeological attention, apart from the excavation of nearby Bronze Age barrow atMousland in 1990 (HY21SW 6).Evidence for prehistoric activity, which was previously unknown at Nether Mousland, consisted of a large mound within an area of rig and furrow (Site 21) and a burnt mound (Site 19). Site 21 consists of a substantial mound (14.3 x 8.6m) with upright stones protruding from the surface onthe W side. The corners of the mound are horned, and it could be the remains of a substantial burial tomb. There is a depression with loose stone to the W of the main mound.A range of geophysical techniques were undertaken focusing on this potential funerary monument (Site 21), with gradiometer survey extending to cover the mound and sheepfold to the NE (Site 10). Although the results are complicated by later agricultural activity, the combination of earth resistance, gradiometry and GPR suggests that the sub-square mound (Site 21) represents at least two phases of activity although a funerary function is difficult to conclusively identify.The strength and nature of gradiometer data to the NE suggests that the mound (Site 10) that underlies the sheepfold represents an earlier, more substantial site, probably domestic in origin. It is possible that this has medieval or perhaps prehistoric origins. This site is positioned centrallywithin the original head dyke enclosure and could be related. It is likely that there are other prehistoric sites in this area, which has escaped modern agricultural improvements since abandonment in the 1850s.The burnt mound (Site 19) is located next to the Burn of Selta and consists of an oval grass covered mound (12.4 x 7.7m) with a hollow on the S side with protruding upright stones. The Nether Mousland Farmstead (Site 1) is surrounded by a head dyke (Sites 6, 16 and 23), which has been extended on the NE and SE sides (Sites 5 and 17). An additional small farmhouse and enclosure (Site 15) is situated outside the northern head dyke (Site 23) and a possible farmsteadis situated to the E (Site 18) within a later phase of head dyke enclosure (Site 17). The farmsteads are located on the periphery or outside of the original head dyke and could be a later phase of inhabitation (post-medieval?). The dyke contains other field boundaries (Sites 7 and 9) and areas of well defined rig and furrow (Sites 11 and 25). The head dykeappends the larger Mousland Farm dyke to the E, an area which is still cultivated. A large concrete dam across the Burn of Selta, outbuildings (pump house?) and pipeline (Sites 12 and 13) were used during WW2 for a water supply. The scheme failed and was soon abandoned. A substantial mound (Site 14, HY21SW 29) by the Burn of Mousland with numerous circular pits cut into the side was assessed. The mound was found to overlay peat deposits that are visible in the burn cutting and is likely to be modern.

It has an overall diameter of about 85 ft., a height of about 9ft. and has been slightly disturbed on top. In the immediate neighbourhood, large stones protrude through the turf but they suggest no definite plan.  RCAHMS 1946, visited 1928.   An amorphous, roughly circular, turf-covered mound covering an area about 26.0m in diameter, still known locally as 'Knowe of Skea'. Traces of indeterminate dry-stone structures and midden material protrude from the S. side where it has been eroded by the sea. Not a cairn but an occupation site of uncertain character.  Visited by OS (RL) 1 July 1970.   Two fragments of Iron Age pottery were recovered from a mixture of burnt stone, animal bone and limpet shell in one of a series of exposures on the southern tip of the mound. No structural features were observed.  The pottery is in Tankerness House Museum (Accession no THM 1984.212).  D S Lynn and B Bell 1984.   A large settlement-mound, about 26m in diameter, in the sea-eroded South side of which can be seen stone walls and midden deposits.  RCAHMS 1983, visited June 1983.   Five pottery sherds and a whetstone fragment were found in exposures on the S face of the mound.  The form of the sherds suggests an Early Iron Age origin.  The pot and the remaining size of the severely eroded mound suggest a possible broch site.  The finds were deposited in Tankerness House Museum (THM 1990.101 - potsherds and THM 1990.102 - whetstone).  D Lynn and B Bell 1990.HY 4414 4181  Rescue excavations were carried out on an eroding mound known as the Knowe of Skea (NMRS HY44SW 2) and on several smaller mounds in the near vicinity. The Knowe of Skea is situated at the S extremity of Berst Ness and has previously been interpreted both as a cairn and as a settlement mound. Assessment excavation revealed it to be a chambered cairn. The mound is over 20m in diameter; at its centre is a large oval chamber and there are indications of up to four smaller surrounding cells. The central chamber is unusually large, measuring some 7m by almost 4.5m. It appears to have been deliberately filled in with deposits containing large amounts of fish bone, shell and animal bone; a few sherds of pottery and some worked bone objects have also been found. The surface of the mound was found to be littered with fragments of bone. At least two later Bronze Age burials were inserted into the exterior of the cairn. In one case, the crouched skeleton of a young adult was found in a shallow pit cut into the surface of the cairn. Towards the periphery of the cairn, a stone-lined cist was found set into the cairn. Work has also taken place on a series of five smaller structures on Berst Ness. All have been identified as burial monuments.Sponsor:	Historic ScotlandH Moore and G Wilson 2000Middle Iron Age burials HY 440 420 A season of excavation was carried out at the Knowe of Skea (HY44SW 2) during autumn 2004.

This was followed by partial excavation by CFA on behalf of Historic Scotland, establishing that the cairn has an unusual kerb about 8.4m diameter.The cairn is located in a field, on a gently rising summit immediately W of the existing road, A859.M R Curtis and G R Curtis 1995.NB 2179 3473  In the course of road widening through Breasclete, a hitherto unknown kerb cairn of unusual morphology was revealed. Located 1.6km from the Callanish standing stones, the new site seems to form part of the wider ceremonial complex. When soil stripping for the road improvement scheme began, R and M Curtis discovered a scatter of flaked quartz on the line of the road. Work on the road was delayed by Western Isles Council whilst an excavation was carried out between October and December 1995.The identified structure was deturfed and excavated by hand, and three phases recognised.Phase 1: Pre-cairn features.  An old ground surface was present below the main material of the cairn. Ard marks were sealed beneath this cairn material, predominantly in the NE quadrant. The ard marks ran both N-S and E-W. No ard marks were discovered outside the area occupied by the cairn. Whilst this may reflect differing preservation, especially as the general area has been cultivated in more recent times, a ritual explanation cannot be discounted.A large number of post-holes were also sealed by the old ground surface (see entry below). It is probable that they were cut from a higher level than the old ground surface, but were only preserved coherently beneath this layer. Certainly a number of the post-holes seem to flank the path into the cairn (see below) and should properly be regarded as part of phase 2, although they only survived as negative features in the till. Phase 2: The kerb cairn.  The cairn was unusual in having two kerbs. The outer kerb was c 8m in diameter and roughly circular. It was constructed of large local stones, laid flat, not set on end as appears to be the case in most other kerb cairns. It had been heavily robbed in places, surviving at its most complete in the SW quadrant. In the NE quadrant both kerbs had been heavily disturbed. The inner kerb elsewhere was formed of smaller stones and survived particularly well on the W side of the monument, although its shape could still be discerned on the E side. It took the form of a flattened circle, the flattened portion being on the E side. It appeared that the 'mathematical construction axis' of this inner kerb points directly up the avenue of the main site at Callanish. The maximum diameter of the inner kerb was about 6.5m.A central cist within the cairn was formed by three orthostats (one alleged) set into the subsoil. A slightly broken, plain cremation urn lay next to the W orthostat and a quantity of the cremated bone which had spilled from the urn was found to its S. No covering slab was found. It is possible that such a slab had been robbed, as the site had been horse-ploughed and drained, and had no significant overburden. An organic covering can also be envisaged. Pollen analysis of samples taken from the central cist may confirm this.A pathway of flat-laid slabs led to the central cist from the NE. This feature was apparently flanked by posts (see above).The SW portion of the cairn was heightened by the presence of large boulders. The remainder of the inner cairn material was of redeposited peaty soil. Layers of orange and black burnt peat were predominant in the cairn construction in the NW portion. Although no stratigraphic link existed between the central cist and this burnt material, it is probable that the peat was deposited later, as it respected the cist spatially. This argues against the peat having been burnt in situ; a hypothesis which will be tested by the analysis of magnetic susceptibility samples taken",https://canmore.org.uk/site/110238/,,,1,2,2,CANMORE,NUMLINK,110238,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,,1

They had been placed on a sandy mound that was partially revetted by a stone kerb and were accompanied by two jet beads and a copper alloy pin. A third feature that was initially thought to be the capping of a long cist was investigated to the N, but it proved not to seal any burials. The form of the excavated burials and the artefacts suggest a date in the 2nd or 3rd millennium BC, consistent with the other finds in the vicinity.Archive: RCAHMS (intended).

Beneath the basal flag an unbaked clay object (SF23) was found.Cremation pits with potential pyre goods: Twelve burials contained odd pottery sherds; rims and bases were of a nondescript type. The adherence of charcoal to several sherds is an indication that they accompanied the body on to the pyre, and this would account for the fact that only a few sherds of each vessel were found. Apart from this there was only one other example of the deposition of grave goods. Two slate implements came from F18 and were in very fragmentary condition (fig 6) because of penetration by roots. They bore no indication of having been burnt and could not have been on the pyre.Knowe 2: The cist contained a small heap of cremated bone and one sherd of pottery.Knowe 3: Two separate piles of cremated bone were found on the basal flag together with three sherds of pottery. One heap was beneath the fallen flagstones, and the other was on the N edge of the basal flag, apparently outside the area of the cist.

This suggests that the cist must have been situated within a now eroded mound. The cist had been inserted through the existing ground surface, a small patch of which was preserved on the N side of the cist. Elsewhere all sand deposits outside the cist are almost entirely scoured.  A rough arc of boulders around 1.5m from the S and W of the cist may have delimited the extent of the mound.  Archive and publication reports of fieldwork results are currently in preparation.  Sponsor: Historic Scotland  CFA 1992.In August 1994 two further Viking Age graves were excavated beside the three adult burials recorded in 1992 (supra).  Further erosion within a deflation hollow on the SE slopes of Cnip headland had revealed human bones in an eroding sand face less than 1m W of the 1992 excavations. A bone pin, two amber beads and a small quantity of human bone were recovered by a representative of Historic Scotland during an initial site inspection.Subsequent excavation revealed a substantially eroded grave, comprising a rounded scoop filled by light brown sand, and containing an infant orientated NW-SE. Only the skull and upper left torso of the skeleton were preserved in situ.  A single amber bead was recovered from beneath the jaw, suggesting that it had formed part of a necklace.During cleaning of areas of exposed ground surface contemporary with the Viking Age cemetery a second grave was located adjacent to that detailed above.  Upon excavation, it contained an undisturbed flexed neonate inhumation orientated approximately E-W.  A small lump of iron, as yet unidentified, was located beneath the rear of the skull.  The burial lay within a rounded scoop measuring 0.66m E-W by 0.48m by up to 0.20m deep and containing a light brown sand fill.  As with the other burial, no surface marking of the grave was evident.Cleaning of exposed areas of ground surface on a terrace up to 3.8m wide revealed no evidence for further graves within c 9m SW and c 6m NE of the excavated grave group. The burials excavated in 1992 and 1994 therefore appear to have formed a discrete cluster, possibly reflecting familial or kinship relationships. The grave group lay on a level patch of ground, and it is likely that the graves were deliberately sited on a terrace on the hillside.  No evidence for any formal boundary to the cluster of graves was identified.Three other eroding features were examined during fieldwork.  A cluster of stones c 1.5m across, located c 1m N of a multi-phase Bronze Age cairn excavated by J Close-Brooks in 1976 and 1978, had been identified as a possible cist roof.  No structure was revealed within the stones; two pits at least 1m in diameter were partly revealed in the trench immediately to the E of this.  The stones lay on a Bronze Age cultivated soil previously identified by Close-Brooks, indicating that the features were broadly contemporary with the adjacent cairn.A disturbed cobble hearth was identified c 15m NE of the calm.  An irregular patch of dark grey sand lay adjacent to the hearth.

It was completely excavated in 1937, and the upper chamber covered with a domed roof.  The cairn has a diamaeter of about 30' and is bounded by a wall-face of horizontally laid stones.  Surrounding the cairn is a spread of loose flat stones forming a sort of platform. An alley, clear of stones, led through it up to the W edge of the cairn. The cairn covers two separate chambers, one directly above the other. The upper, at ground level and entered from the N or uphill side, is placed centrally in the cairn; the lower is subterranean and entered from the S.  The passage to the upper chamber is 11' long, 1' 9"" wide and 3' maximum high. The upper chamber measures 15' 6"" by 6', its main axis at right angles to the passage. It is divided into two unequal compartments with rounded ends. Three stone cists, measuring about 1' 6"" by 2', with cover-stones, had been built on a layer of earth about 1' thick between two upright slabs in the N wall of the W compartment. The lower chamber is entered by a passage 2' wide and 4' high at its inner end but contracting to 1' 5"" and 2' high at the outermost lintel. The passage is 19' long from the chamber thus continuing 5' 6"" outside the cairn above. Outside the roofed passage the sloping sides of the trench are visible, lined with walling but without lintels. The walls continue down the hillside for 19' narrowing to only 2 1/2"" wide by the entrance to the ""miniature chamber"". This small channel has been called a drain but this is obviously not its purpose.  The lower chamber is entirely subterranean and roughly oval with the main axis at right angles to the passage.  It measures 12' long by 5' 4"" wide and is divided by five vertical slabs into four compartments opening from a central space. The miniature chamber at the end of the passage extension is also subterranean. It is roughly oval in plan, the main axis lying SW-NE, 5' long by 4'4"" wide. Four upright slabs are set radially in the wall and hardly project into the chamber.  The entrance is by a vertical drop into a narrow extension of the chamber on the SW.

At least 32 male and 27 female skeletons. If better preservation the total may have been 394. Some human bones occurred in the floor deposits associated with animal and bird bones,  and a complete human skeleton was found in one of the compartments. The stony filling of the chamber also contained human bones - mostly broken and fragmentary. Each individual represented by only a few bones, generally spread haphazardly horizontally but in one cell or part of the chamber. Some bones had signs of burning but there were very few gnaw marks although Chesterman and Renfrew argued they had been defleshed elsewhere. There was a bias in rather few skull and other bone fragments. In pit at S end of chamber were fragments of an articulated crouched adult male burial with some bones of a female teenager and one child vertebra.A total of 20 new AMS radiocarbon determinations on human bone have been obtained for theNeolithic chamber tomb of Quanterness, Orkney. The results show poor agreement with the recorded stratigraphy, suggesting extensive mixing of the chamber deposits. A Bayesian model treating all of the determinations as deriving from a single phase of activity provides a start date in the range 3510– 3220 cal bc (most probably falling after 3450 cal bc), with the main phase of burial activity ending in the range 2850–2790 cal bc (95.4% probability). This presents a tighter range than previously available, but nevertheless appears to confirm the longevity of burial activity at the monument. Osteologically, there is no convincing evidence for excarnation, and the representation of the small  ones of the hands and feet, together with the absence of sub-aerial weathering, make it unlikely that the bulk of the human bone assemblage was brought in from elsewhere, as had previously been suggested.Human bones  were in a predominantly disarticulated highly fragmented and chaotic state .

The chamber lies at HWM and is highly vulnerable to tidal erosion and scouring.Excavations revealed an inner and outer chamber divided by a substantial threshold slab. The inner chamber was neatly paved, as Beveridge had suggested, and also incorporated a hearth in its NW corner. Further excavation, in a 1 x 1m area where there was no paving, revealed underlying and apparently undisturbed deposits, the earliest of which was a dark silty material banked up against the sides of the chamber.Paving in the outer chamber had been all but removed by scouring, apparently since Beveridge's time, revealing a partial lower paving of small stones and a post-hole containing two sherds of Neolithic pottery (Hebridean Ware), probably residual.The paving and associated features in both chambers appear to date to a period after the removal of the tomb's capstones, possibly in the Bronze Age or later, and may relate to secondary buildings built into the body of the cairn. The excavations have, however, demonstrated the survival of earlier deposits and artefactual remains at risk from further erosion and scouring.Sponsor: Historic ScotlandI Armit 1996.NF 7684 7520  Further excavations were conducted during May 1997 at the Neolithic chambered tomb of Geirisclett (NMRS NF 77 NE 15). Trial excavations in 1996 (Armit 1996) had demonstrated that primary tomb deposits in the burial chamber and passage areas had survived previous investigations c 1900-10 by Erskine Beveridge, but that these were now under threat of scouring by tidal action. The 1997 season was designed to excavate fully any deposits surviving in the burial chamber and passage areas in advance of their destruction.

The tomb had been inserted into subsoil, possibly a drumlin, on an E-facing hillside. It measured c 3 x 3m and comprised three cells with an entrance, arranged in a clover-leaf formation. The height of the tomb did not exceed 1m. It was constructed of coursed drystone masonry with orthostatic partitions. The wall-heads were corbelled to receive the roof, which was constructed of six large flagstones, found largely intact. The drumlin into which the tomb was constructed was enhanced with stone forming a low cairn of stone with clay. The cairn has not been fully explored, but initial observations indicate it is over 25m in diameter. No revetment walls or external entrance passage have been found in the cairn material. A narrow gap formed between the uppermost roof slab and a notch in the entrance lintel suggest a 'light box'. The exact orientation and function of this feature is still under analysis. The restricted area immediately outside the tomb entrance, formed between the entrance and the cut in the subsoil, was blocked by a series of horizontally laid blocking stones. Matching this on the inside of the tomb, and filling the internal entrance passage, was a tightly fitting but stepped blocking which was inserted from the inside. Preliminary results of the excavation suggest that the internal blocking provided a stepped access from the roof into the tomb interior. The uppermost of the roofing stones had been fitted so that while the tomb was in use it was possible to slide it to one side. After the final use of  the tomb, the roof  was capped by a 40?50cm layer of clay and stone.Deposits within the tomb were minimal. The floor was virtually clean and no artefacts were recovered on it. However, in two cells the remains of four individuals were encountered. The human remains were in an extremely poor condition. Alternating wet and dry conditions may account for the poor preservation. Extensive sampling within the tomb for soil micromorphological analysis has taken place.External to the tomb and also inserted into the cairn material were two cists and one cremation. One cist survived only partially intact as at least one side slab had been previously removed by ploughing. One side of the cist was revetted by a small wall of coursed masonry. Human teeth were the only remains to be found in the deposits within this cist. The second cist had exceptional preservation. It contained the remains of two large deposits of human bone, one of which had been encased in a finely woven basket of plant fibres. Cramp, possibly melted copper and other residues, was also found in the cist. The cist lay at an angle within the cairn material, with one side propped by two leaning stones. It was also capped by two flagstones laid on top of each other, but separated by a vertical stone. The cut within the cairn material was backfilled with loose rubble and some clay. Sponsors: Historic Scotland,  Orkney Ice-cream, A plant.B Ballin-Smith, J Duncan and C Richards 1998HY 440 098 A second and final season of archaeological work at the tomb took place in July 1999 (see Ballin-Smith, Duncan and Richards 1998). There were several outstanding questions from the first season. The entrance area of the tomb was complex with its two blockings and the lack of any formal external approach to the tomb. The floor of the tomb and the construction of its walls were also features which demanded further investigation. There was also the question of whether there were other satellite Bronze Age cists, additional to those found previously. Finally, there was the mound the tomb was dug into: was this a man-made or natural feature? Further geophysical work was undertaken in a much wider area around the tomb, but no further cists were located.

Though the cairn is said to be `almost square in plan?, it may be more D-shaped, with the facade on the ESE bowing outwards and the NNW and SSW sides narrowing slightly towards the rear, WNW, side. The cairn is grass grown with loose stones strewn across its interior and is defined by a peristalith of large slabs with little evidence of drystone masonry surviving between them. What may have been the stone forming the WSW corner lies flat, partly hidden in the heather. The entrance is more or less central to the facade with a short passage 1.4m long leading to an oval chamber; both the passage and chamber are set askew to the axis of the facade. Seven slabs make up the chamber, the tallest standing 2m high at the rear, W, end. The axis of the chamber extends through this slab and coincides not only with the tallest stone still standing on the WNW side of the peristalith, but also the largest stone on the facade. The remains of an Iron Age house (NF86NW 18) overlie the E of the cairn, while on the WSW, 7m beyond the peristalith, there is an impressive standing stone. This measures 1.45m in breadth by 0.15m in thickness and stands 2.6m in height in a water-filled peaty hollow with some chocking stones exposed around its base. Visited by RCAHMS (ARG,SPH) 23 September 2010",https://canmore.org.uk/site/10234/,,,3,5,5,CANMORE,NUMLINK,10234,,,NMS,Accession No., X.EO 862,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,http://nms.scran.ac.uk/database/results.php?QUICKSEARCH=1&search_term=unival,,,,2

The top of the cist was barely below the surface of the farmyard in front of the steading 4m E of the NE corner of the house, which occupies the summit of a low rise one of many such hillocks in the area.

In this area beneath some 80mm of farmyard metalling, a packing of horizontally-laid flat slabs was encountered, with several layers of such slabs underneath them. It was clear that these were the remains of a cairn of stones which had been built around the cist. The lower half of the cist cavity was dug into natural clay. It appeared that the stones of the cairn had simply been carried corbel-fashion over the cist to form its roof.The cist, which has its longer axis NNW-SSE, is made of 4 slabs uniformly some 30mm thick.

Food Vessels are quite rare in Orkney ,95,"The site is on the south-eastern edge of a shoulder of the hillside, falling away more steeply to the S and E. This shoulder provides a prominent platform at a height of 30 m above ODand 29 m above the Loch of Stenness. Around the cist, a patch of reddish clay soil contrasted with the dark peaty soil of the rest of the field, and a similar patch could be seen 15 m to the N. These patches may represent the sites of tumuli entirely removed by ancient cultivation. Although this land was hill grazing before improvement in the late nineteenth century, it is likely to have been farmland in the remote past; in this part of Orkney much land went out of cultivation during the agricultural depression of the fifteenth century, in the neighbouring parish of Sandwick some 60% of land going out of production.The cover slab of the cist lay at a depth just within the reach of the heavy plough, which struck and displaced it . The southern end of the slab broke off and fell into the the cist, along with a quantity of ploughsoil. The width of the slab exceeded the width of the cist, being 950 mm wide and 990 mm long after the breakage. The cist has its longer axis on a bearing of 162 degrees, i.e. approximately SSE-NNW. The sides are formed of a naturally-flat-surfaced slabs, that forming the E side being 1090 mm long, the W side 1070 mm, the N end-slab 730 mm, and the S end-slab 720 mm. At the SE corner, the E end of the S end-slab was not quite perfectly shaped to give a tright abutment against the E side-slab, and small eke stones had been inserted to fill the gaps. The height of the cist-walls was governed by the height of the two side-slabs, which was not quite matched by the two end-slabs, so at both ends, further eke stones had been used to bring the heights of the end-walls up to the constant height to receive the cover-slab. The two side-slabs and the N end-slab are notably thin, being 30 mm thick, but the S end-slab has a thickness of 90 mm.The baseslab, which rested directly on the underlying natural rock and clay, fitted tightly and precisely within the space defined by the four verticals. It lay at a depth of 580 mm below the underside of the cover-slab, and evidently had been one large slab although now broken up by many fractures. This base-slab however did not extend to the S end of the cist, but was broken across diagonally, and the bottom of the cist at this end was formed by the natural rock. It was on this natural rock surface that the pot had been placed. It appeared that the base-slab may have originally extended all the way to the end, and that the removal of the southern end was a secondary action. As it was, the base-slab stopped short of the S end of the cist by 400 mm on the E side and by 180 mm on the W.Somewhat N of the centre-point of the cist-bottom, the base-slab was marked by a neatly circular dark stain 280 mm in diameter, which possibly marked the position of cremated remains entirely dissolved in the acid soil. It is an alternative possibility however that the original deposition had been removed during a re-use of the cist, when the pot was inserted after the removal of the southern part of the base-slab.Apart fromthe pot, the cist contained nothing except the ploughsoil which fell into its S end at the time of discovery. It was of course inevitable that the part of the cover-slab to break and fall down into the cist should do so directly onto the pot, which seems to have been standing upright close to the S end-slab. Some of the sherds which broke off at that moment, came out with the cover-slab when this was pulled out by the tractor driver and were recovered from the trampled area around the cist, and a few others may not have been found, but the main broken edge of the pot appears to be an old one, as if the pot had been incomplete when deposited.The flagstone bedrock on this shoulder is in places very close to the surface, and advantage seems to have been taken of a weakness in the rock to cut a rec",http://canmore.rcahms.gov.uk/en/site/309547/,,,1,1,1,CANMORE,NUMLINK,309547,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/search?keyword=Hollicondane,,,,4886,1

The cist contained both inhumations and cremations, one of the latter being placed in an urn.

A collection of poorly preserved unburnt bone was found to comprise the remains of two individuals: a young adult and a foetus. Two collections of cremated bone, each derived from a single adult, were also present; one in a Food Vessel Urn, the second forming a pile on the floor and containing two burntantler tines and two unburnt human teeth. The un-urned cremation deposit and the unburnt bones had been covered in mats of plant fibres derived from grass and sedge. The urn had been lined with basketry, also made from grass. Outside the cist, an exceptionally large   llection of fuel ash slag (FAS), derived from a cremation pyre, had been deposited between the cist and the wall of the rock-cut chamber. Radiocarbon dates indicate that the site and its contents had a long history. The FAS and the foetus skeleton date to 2900-2500 cal BC. Between 2200 and 1900 cal BC the urned cremation and young adult human bones were inserted and charcoal was deposited in the foundation slots for the back wall of the cist. The deposition of the un-urned cremation was dated to 1000-800 cal BC, some 900 years later, when the urn had already fallen over and broken. At this time, it is assumed that the urn was restored to an upright position and propped with stones, while the stone lid for the urn was reused in the foundation slot of the left-hand side of the cist.

The burial ? which may be older than the roundhouse rather than a foundation deposit ? consisted of a single individual probably male and aged about 12 years.  The skeleton had been dismembered by butchery probably some time after death when the body was partly decomposed, and the fragments distributed among the four pits.  Cannibalism was ruled out as there were none of the marks of skinning, filleting and butchering which were found on the animal bones.  Barber suggests that the boy may have died under ?inauspic-ious circumstances?, perhaps at sea,  and had therefore been buried in this peculiar way when he was found on the beach [3, 778].The pits under the roundhouse were dated to between 460 +/- 50 bc (GU-2161) and 385+/- 50 bc (GU-2017);  these dates are not calibrated for carbonate retention [3]. Sources: 1.

This was the burial of a woman probably aged 35-45. She was buried in a square barrow, and a two-wheel horse-drawn vehicle had been placed, dismantled, into the grave. The burial probably dates to the first half of the second century BC and can be compared with other Middle Iron Age vehicle burials from East Yorkshire.The barrow was located on the north side of the modern village of Wetwang. Unlike previously excavated vehicle or chariot burials, this barrow was located on a hill-top, rather than in a valley. The burial is located approximately 1.5-2 km to the south east of the large Iron Age cemetery and settlement at Wetwang Slack excavated in the in the 1970s. Three chariot burials were also found nearby during gravel quarrying in the 1980s. These other burials lay in the valley running east-west on the north side of the ridge on which this burial was located.The sequence of events leading to the burial can be reasonably reconstructed. The grave was dug to accommodate the body of the vehicle. The body (2001,0401.20) may have been brought to the grave side on the horse drawn vehicle, and was carefully handed down and laid out on top of some form of mat, cloth or organic matter of rectangular shape at the south end of the grave. The body may have been held in a bag fastened with a strap union (2001,0401.18), or this fitting may have served some other purpose. The woman was buried head towards the south, which is unusual. She was buried with an iron mirror (2001,0401.19) that was placed in the grave inside a fur-lined bag. The bag was closed with a draw string or similar threaded with unusual tiny blue glass beads (2001,0401.22). The draw string had been wrapped around a coral-decorated tightly involuted brooch (2001,0401.21). Cuts of pig meat were also placed over her body (2001,0401.43-56). At some stage in the sequence of events the vehicle was taken apart. The wheels and the box/body were removed from the axle, pole and yoke, which remained fixed together. The terrets remained in place on the yoke and the reigns and other harness wrapped around the yoke. The axle, pole and yoke were placed over the body, followed by the box/body of the vehicle. The wheels were placed over the pole. Although the wooden chariot itself was not preserved, all of the metal harness and chariot fittings were recovered from the grave (2001,0401.1-17). The quantity of coral used as decoration on some of the metal objects is exceptional in a British Iron Age context. The grave was finally infilled with clay, and a low mound or barrow left over the top of the grave. Whether the square ditch around the burial was dug before or after the burial is not clear. The horses that led the vehicle to the grave were taken away. People visited the burial after the funeral, and at times left pig and other animal bones/remains (2001,0401.59-80) and some human bone (2001,0401.57-8) either on the barrow to erode into the ditch, or in the ditch itself. Small amounts of pottery (2001,0401.23-34) were also found in the ditches or upper grave fill.",,,,1,,1,,,,,,British Museum,Accession No.,n/a,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x98478,http://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=5153&plaA=5153-3-1,,,,1

The site has been excavated by Edward Cunnington (1884), Sir Mortimer Wheeler (1934-1937) and N Sharples (1985-1986). The earliest features to be identified include a group of pits associated with Early Neolithic flint working, believed to date to around 4000 BC when the hilltop was first cleared of woodland. A causewayed enclosure was built soon after, on the eastern plateau, which may have contained a long barrow and is associated with two infant burials. The Iron Age hillfort overlies this enclosure. In around 3500 BC, after the enclosure had fallen out of use, a bank barrow was constructed, part of which overlies the western end of the enclosure. In the Later Neolithic and Bronze Age periods two barrows and a small enclosure were constructed. (23, 28, 29)There are believed to be three main phases for the Iron Age occupation of the site. Initially, in the Early Iron Age, it was a univallate hillfort, defined by a single rampart comprising of a chalk bank, an outer ditch and intervening berm. These ramparts were broken by entrances to the east and west guarded by timber gates. During the second half of the 3rd century BC, the ramparts were extended to the west and during the mid-2nd century BC, the ramparts were rebuilt on a larger scale. The ramparts of the later multivallate hillfort consisted of three banks and two ditches around the hilltop, with an extra bank and ditch to the south, and two complex entrances. The interior of the fort was intensively occupied. Excavation revealed traces of circular and rectangular huts evident from post holes, trenches and floor remains as well as what has been interpreted as roads, gullies, storage pits and ovens. The largest circular building is believed to have developed into a shrine. Over 50 human burials have also been identified, many within a cemetery at the eastern end of the site. One of the most notable finds was a Roman ballista within the vertebrae of an adult man. (2A, 12, 23)Occupation of the hilltop declined following the Roman Conquest, and the Roman town of Durnovaria (now Dorchester) was established to the north east at Dorchester. A Romano-Celtic temple was built at the eastern end of the fort, during the 4th century AD. The building comprised a central block, or cella, surrounded by a corridor or verandah, within a walled precinct. The cella may have had a black and white mosaic floor, while the corridor had a red tesserated pavement. The structure was built of flint and limestone and roofed with stone tiles, later replaced by clay. During the post-Roman period the hilltop was used to graze stock and a number of dewponds were constructed to provide water.

She had two decorative copper-alloy toe-rings on the feet. A piece of deer antler, drilled with six holes, lay on her chest. Her body had been laid carefully on its back, with arms by the side, some time after the initial construction of the metalworking structure. After her burial, use of the building continued, presumably as normal. Bayesian modelling of the 14C dates suggest that both were buried about the same time c. 50 BC - 1AD.A 25-35 year old male was buried in a short pit (too small for body) just outside the smithy and covered by midden material. A complete skeleton was revealed, dating to around 100BC-100AD. His right toes were bent back and protruded out of the side of the pit and some of his toe bones were found behind his back. The skull was badly crushed by large stone slabs that were used to cover the burial. Lots of shells etc but grave fill in very middeny. He had met a violent end and may have been ritually killed. The concentration of injuries to the man’s left side indicates an attack to the defensive side of his body, suggesting that the victim was armed when the attack happened. It seems likely that the projectile injury was the first wound, inflicted from some distance behind, perhaps to slow him down. The spear or arrow may have pinned the shoulder bone.

A good few years before 1979 a school-teacher moved some stone on the summit and found an opening with steps leading down. The proprietor caused the opening to be re-sealed.RCAHMS 1987, visited April 1979.An underground chamber relating to the mound was rediscovered in 1999. An excavation was undertaken and the mound, though natural, contained a chamber and was surrounded by a ditch. For a full account, see MS/1040/3.NMRS MS/1043/1This subterranean structure has been sunk into a natural mound in an area of undulating ground about 100m SE of the cemetery on Churchyard Road, Tankerness. The mound itself, which is indistinguishable from other natural mounds in the vicinity, is about 3m in height, and it formerly lay at the centre of an oval ditched enclosure measuring some 41m from N to S by 37m transversely internally, with a broad entrance facing towards the W (Card et al. 2000 (NMRS MS 1040/3), GSB 1999 (NMRS MS 2000/1)). No trace of the ditch is now visible, but the mound occupies the whole of the interior, and the ground rises gradually from roughly the line of its inner lip to the summit where a modern pit has been sunk and now provides access to the mouth of the structure below. Built of drystone masonry, the latter lies beneath the centre of the mound and comprises two flights of stone steps, the upper of which leads down to a half-landing and the entrances to two subsidiary galleries, and the lower on down to a corbelled chamber at the bottom.The structure appears to have been constructed in a pit about 4.4m in diameter, and the floor of the corbelled chamber at the bottom lies 7.4m below the top of the mound. The pit in the summit, which now contains metal stairs, has been dug down 1.85m, revealing that the material above the structure is composed of unconsolidated earth and stone, perhaps largely derived from midden. The upper flight, comprising seventeen ladder-like steps, drops down from N to S between coursed drystone walls for a further 2.75m to the half-landing on to which the two subsidiary galleries open. The S wall of the half-landing is formed by natural till, and presumably forms the S side of the pit in which the structure is built. The entrance to the lower gallery is about 0.6m square and its sill is 0.43m above the half-landing; the gallery itself is no more than 0.4m in width at one point and it extends back in a shallow arc for about 2.4m. The upper gallery, the sill of its entrance 1.42m above the half-landing, runs back above the roof of the lower flight of steps and the corbelled chamber; some 2.8m in length, it is much wider and higher than the lower gallery, measuring up to 0.9m in width and 1.25m in height at its inner end. Midden deposits are visible on the N side where the masonry at the inner end has collapsed. The capstones of the roof above the ladder steps is about 2.7m above the half-landing, but two other lintels span the void, acting as tie-beams between the walls flanking the steps. This structural technique relieves the dead-weight of the masonry above the structure, and, whatever other functions the galleries may have fulfilled, they too serve this purpose.From the half-landing the stair turns back on itself, descending a further 1.9m in a flight of eleven steps to a sill 0.9m above the floor of the corbelled chamber. The latter is about 1.3m in diameter and the capstones of its roof are 4.1m above the floor. The drop down from the lowest step gives the chamber a cistern-like appearance, and the fissures between two massive sandstone slabs forming the floor, which are probably bedrock, are filled with clay. The chamber does not hold water at present, but the present water table may be below the level of its floor.",https://canmore.org.uk/site/2998,70396,2,1,,1,CANMORE,NUMLINK,2998,,,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x43223,,,,,1

They revealed buildings, boundaries, burials and tracks associated with a late Iron Age and early Roman ladder settlement and showed that its origins lay in the early centuries of the first millennium BC. Many occupation sites of this period, in East Yorkshire, show little apparent change at the time of the Roman conquest but here there were clear transformations. Buildings were abandoned just before the conquest and new boundaries were laid out soon after. The burial sequence ran from the early Bronze Age to the late Iron Age and included a rare early Iron Age inhumation cemetery, pre-dating the region's famous square barrow burials by a couple of centuries. There was also a small group of Anglo-Saxon burials with contemporary 7th century occupation, and medieval remains on the edge of the modern village of Melton.<On-Site Archaeology website summary>: The archaeological potential of the site was already known before work began on the road improvements. The lines of ditches buried beneath the crop in the arable field at South Lawn had been spotted on an aerial photograph, taken in 1976. This showed that the area north of the A63 was crossed by ditches running east to west in parallel with the modern road. They seemed to run along the side of an ancient and long forgotten trackway. This was crossed by other ditches running north to south. The layout of the ditches looked very much like other sites from the region, which are known as ladder settlements and date from the late Iron Age or early Roman period (c. 150 BC to c. 300 AD). Sites like these are important as they span the period of the Roman conquest and can tell us how the Roman occupation may have affected the lives of the people who already lived here. At Melton we had the rare opportunity to investigate the remains of a ladder settlement on a large scale. This confirmed that the site was occupied between about 100 BC and 300 AD. It also showed that the ladder settlement originated much earlier than expected. Furthermore, some elements, such as the trackway, survived for centuries, after the Roman period, until at least the seventh century AD.",,70392,,3,,3,HER_Humber,MonUID,MHU8241,PrefRef,8241,,,,https://www.britishmuseum.org/collection/term/x43223,,,,,2

At the time, it was circa 18 feet high and 40 feet in diameter. The mound was covered by a layer of flints 2.5 feet thick. Below this were layers of ""brown and black mould"", interspersed with some thin deposits of ashes. At the centre was a cairn of flints, the lower portion of which comprised broken and chipped flints while the upper portion comprised large unbroken flints. Beneath the cairn was a chalk-cut pit containing on its floor two crouched inhumations and a deposit of cremated bone. The cairn had been piled up directly on top of these. Between the upper and lower parts of the cairn was an extended child inhumation with a small pottery vessel. Near the top of the cairn was a cremation in a collared urn.

The similarities between the burials are remarkable; both are children, both were articulated, both were covered with flint and both were deposited with artefacts. The child in segment 18 was buried with a flint flake and three tubular bone beads, two made from mammal limb bones, and one from a large bird, possibly a swan (Mercer 1980, 31). In segment 17 two chalk lumps carved with criss-crossed lines were placed behind the child’s head (Mercer 1980, 31). Both children’s appearance would have been affected by the premature fusing of their skulls (McKinley 2008, 511). What is even more striking, however, is that they were buried between 160 and 250 years apart (Healy 2004, table 1; Mercer & Healy 2008). The older burial, from phase I or II of segment 18 dates to between 3660 and 3540 cal. bc, the younger, from phase VII of segment 17, to between 3380 and 3320 cal. bc (Mercer & Healy 2008, 101). They represent the only completely articulated burials discovered in the main enclosure, in contrast to the evidence for the exposure of corpses at the site, and the extensive deposition of disarticulated human bone.NB grid reference is taken from Pastscape record for causewayed enclosure",1454,"<Pastscape site description (causewayed enclosure)>: An Early Neolithic causewayed enclosure on the summit of Hambledon Hill, of which one third survives as earthwork and the remainder has been ploughed flat. It is interpreted as the central focus of a large complex of Neolithic monuments which occupy spurs of the hill in addition to its central summit (the hillfort spur to the north, the Shroton spur to the east, the Stepleton spur to the south, and the Hanford spur to the west). The main enclosure is one of the largest causewayed enclosures in England (circa 9 hectares), and is divided from the radiating spurs by pairs of cross-dykes which may equate to the middle and outer circuits of other complex enclosures. In 1974-86 a major programme of excavation directed by Roger Mercer examined most major earthworks on the Hill. The ditch contained placed deposits of human skulls and other bones, plus considerable quantities of animal bones. Stone axes from a variety of sources, and pottery from mainly local sources were also present. The abundant cultural material retrieved from the site has provided information about the community, including conflict, feasting, the treatment of the human corpses, exchange, stock management and agriculture. The disposal of individual artefacts and remains reflect the diverse use of the monument. Use of the enclosures and the construction of its individual parts was episodic, spread over 300-400 years, and was not representative of a lasting settlement. The relationship with Cranborne Chase to the east is highlighted by the cessation of activity on the hill in the late fourth millennium at the same time that the Dorset cursus and other monuments were built in the Chase. Renewed activity on the hill in the late 3rd and early 2nd millennia preceded occupation in the mid to late 2nd millennium, which was followed by the construction of a hillfort on the northern spur from the early 1st millennium. Later Iron Age, Romano-British, and Saxon activity has also been recorded on the hill.

The monument consists of a central domed structure, containing cists and with a pit beneath, surrounded by an outer cairn also containing cists. An entrance grave is located in the external side of the outer cairn. After excavation, Borlase conserved the mound structure to display the more prominent features. This involved building a new retaining wall which has changed the appearance of the outer mound from a round cairn to a ring cairn. Interpretation of the sequence of the site is problematic, due to the patchy antiquarian excavation records and from the restoration. Sharpe's survey (h5) and report of 1990 (b13) re-assesses the excavation record and provides alternative sequences of mound construction, postulated in the light of recent studies of entrance graves and barrows. One of the cists found within the central part of the mound was a double cist, formed with a cental granite dividing stone.

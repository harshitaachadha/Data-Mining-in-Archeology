The Beaker is an early type, equating to Clarke's Wessex/Mid Rhine Group or step 3 of the Lanting and van der Waals scheme, thought to date to around 2300 BC. The skeleton though was radiocarbon dated to 1902 (+/- 33) BC. This apparently conforms to a recognised local pattern of late dates for apparently early Beaker styles. Other grave goods found with the burial were three barbed and tanged flint arrowheads found near the lower back, an angular flint in the chest area and a tiny fragment of amber near the head.Decayed oak coffin structure.

Uist>: partial remains of a coastally-eroded in-situ human burial remains were found to be from one individual, probably male, aged between 30-34 years at death with a slight deformity of the spine buried in a supine position in a flat-based grave. A single radiocarbon date suggests burial dates to 390-170 BC. Only a limited portion of the burial was still preserved in-situ including both legs and feet, and the left lower arm and hand; enough, however, remained to identify the burial as a supine inhumation (north-east  to  south-west). Other skeletal elements including the torso of the skeleton were found to have slumped down the slope by c l m.<Duffy in Duffy and MacGregor 2007, 158>: An unusual pathology  was noted on lumbar vertebrae 1 and 2, where the left inferior articular facet of both elements was rotated medially, and shortened by up to 4.8 mm compared to the right inferior articular facet. This pattern also apparent on the first sacral vertebrae, where the left superior articular facet appeared to be slightly rotated medially. No other osseous response was not although much of the rest of the vertebral column was fragmented. The causes of this pathology are not immediately clear. No evidence of a fracture to either spinous process was observed, although it is possible that it is an osseous response to a poorly healed vertebral fracture further up the spinal column. It is also possible that the abnormality may have a genetic origin.rc dates on human bone: SUERC-5368; Human Left Ulna; 2210 +/- 40; 386-183 cal BC Oxcal v.4 (95% confidence)",Adult 19-39,Male,Biography: Diseased/Disabled,Fragment(s),Supine,NE-SW,Unknown

Chop marks were found on the spinal column suggesting dismemberment at the time of death or soon after. Diagonal chops were applied to his back, slicing through the trunk between the waist and the hip. The mixing of body parts in two of the pits also suggested partial decomposition prior to burial (hence a few bones were not in articulated groups). The boy suffered from a slight strain of spina bifida which may or may not have had any physical effects. The human and animal bodies were distributed as follows:Pit 1: hr included lower body parts including the lower right limb and part of the pelvic girdle; animal remains included substantial parts of a juvenille cow/bull (18-30 months in age)Pit 2: hr included the upper trunk, upper limbs and skull of the boyPit 3: hr included the lower trunk, part of the pelvic girdle and stray bones (eg finger, clavicle); animal remains included substantial parts of two female sheep (one 18-30 months in age, the other 3+ years)Pit 4: hr included the boy's left foot. animal remains included substantial parts of a juvenille cow/bull (slightly older than the example in Pit 1)",Child 3-13,Male,Multiple (Additional Notes),Complete,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown

The burial was crouched and aligned northÐsouth. A radiocarbon date of 1450Ð1290 cal BC (GU-13838) was obtained from human bone from the burial.<Duffy in Barrowman and Innes 2009>: Overall  the  adult  showed  well-developed  muscle markings throughout his skeleton, with the right side showing particular muscle development, poten- tially indicating right-handedness. An enthesopathy was also noted at the insertion of tibialis anterious on the left tibia, although the complex aetiology of such osseous changes precludes any assignment of causal factors. Overall these observations indicate that he pursued a vigorous lifestyle and was probably well muscled.Evidence of spinal joint disease was also noted, almost exclusively conÞned to the cervical portion of the spinal column ... The  relatively advanced stage of this condition further reinforces the picture of a vigorous lifestyle and repeated spinal column stress, potentially through heavy lifting and carrying of heavy objects on the back.Dental health was found to be good, although the mandibular teeth were highly worn. Calculus was slight where it existed, and there was a complete absence of evidence of periodontal disease, caries or abscess formation ...Despite his age, no evidence of osteoarthritis was observed on any of the articular surfaces of the adult. This may further strengthen the suggestion that the observed spinal joint disease has a more speciÞc cause than advanced age or a general vigorous lifestyle alone, as osteoarthritic changes may also have reasonably been expected if general age and lifestyle were the causes.",Old Adult >40,Male,Burial (Inhumation): Articulated,Unknown,Crouched (facing right),N-S,Unknown

The total mass was about 2,500 c.c. and represents the cremation of an adult of unknown sex and age. No evidence of more than one subject can be obtained. This pot contained very little charcoal. It suggests that the cremation was very efficiently carried out, though the survival of the odontoid process and its appearance, hints at deficient oxygenation of the pyre beneath the body due to poor stoking.

10135,72826,,Inhumation,"Human bone from a crouched adult male inhumation burial within a cist. The higher part of the body was fairly well-preserved as it was covered by the sandy matrix of layer. However, the underside did not survive so well as it lay directly upon the slate slabs of the bottom of the cist and had been damaged by the acidity of the rock.The position of the bones within the grave appears to indicate a degree of post-mortem disturbance or collapse of the body, as the skull was lying too far away from the pelvis. This may simply be due to burial within a cist, with the potential for movement within the void before the chamber collapsed and was filled with soil. There was evidence for some dental and bony pathology in the main skeleton, which indicated that he probably suffered from some pain in his jaw, neck and lower back. He also had a fractured rib which may have been caused by a fall or a deliberate blow to his side, but it healed well and probably would not have caused too much discomfort after this. Well-developed muscle markings and the strain showing in the bones of his back indicate that his lifestyle was not sedentary, and it is likely that he was involved in some form of manual labour. He may have had a fracture of one toe at some point, and a pulled muscle in his groin. Taken together, this indicates an active life with some potential for injury (Anderson in Jones 2009-10, 87).",Adult 19-39,Male,Multiple (Additional Notes),Unknown,Crouched (facing right),N-S,Unknown

All fragments were greater than 5mm insize, the majority over 10mm (90.5%), and were generally well-preserved and sharp-edged with no evidence of predepositional erosion or post-excavation damage. A total of 45.9% (232 g) were identifiable fragments. No regions of the skeleton were duplicated, all regions were represented, and no fragments diagnostic of juvenile or infant remains were present, suggesting the burial represented the whole body of a single adult. There were insufficient sexually dimorphic elements preserved to provide an estimation of sex. Those criteria used for sex estimation in the original bone report (Cornwall 1965), with the exception of the supraorbital ridge of the frontal bone, are no longer considered reliable indicators. Although there were insufficient indicators preserved to provide a more accurate estimation of age, a tooth with veryworn enamel, a fragment of auricular surface characteristic of an older adult, and the presence of spinal pathologies usually associated with older adults, comprising osteoarthritic porosity of a cervical vertebra (articular facet), and osteophytosis of several vertebrae, are consistent with an adult of more advanced years.

10143,74041,,Cremation,"Mountain Barrows, Pelynt, Pelynt 2 (Higgins in Jones and Quinnell 2013):PELYNT 2This deposit comprised a quantity of predominantly white, calcined/oxidised bone. Fragment size was generally large, with 83.1% of the total deposit measuring greater  than 10 mm. The remaining fragments measured 5Ð10 mm (4.5%), with 12.4% less than 5 mm. The bone fragments were generally well-preserved and sharp-edged with no evidence of pre-depositional  erosion,  but  some  evidence of post-excavation fragmentation was indicated by ÔfreshÕ fractures.The weight of cremated bone (2788 g) is within the expected range (57Ð3000 g) for an undisturbed burial of a single cremated adult from an archaeological context, but above the average (1525.7 g) for the Bronze Age (McKinley 1997; 2000). In total, 76% of the deposit (2123 g) comprised identifiable fragments. No regions of the skeleton were duplicated, and no fragments diagnostic of juvenile or infant remains were present, indicating the burial represented an adult individual. All regions of the skeleton (skull, axial, upper limb, lower limb) were well represented. A large proportion of the bones of the hands and feet were present, also suggesting the deposit represented the Ôwhole bodyÕ of an adult.Pelvic morphology, assessed from large fragments of pubic symphysis and sacrum, suggested the  individual was of male sex and, although observable, cranial sexually dimorphic traits were scored as either female or probable female, the morphology of the pelvis is considered more reliable. In addition, the general robusticity of the skeleton is consistent with a male. However the individual has been assigned as probable male. A fully accurate estimation of age at death was not possible but the fusion of the spheno- occipital suture and completed eruption of the maxillary dentition, including the 3rd molar, indicate an age of at least 20Ð25 years, and the right pubic symphysis (stage III) a probable age of 22Ð35 (mean 28.7) years. Taken together with several other contra-indicators of advanced years the estimated age at death is 22Ð35 years.Borlase (1872, 196) also notes that:' Not a particle of charcoal or ashes could be detected among the fragments of bone'. The clean state of the bone is supported by Higgins 2013).Dates on cremated bone: SUERC-38742, 3525 ± 30BP (1935Ð1756 cal BC), SUERC-38743, 3565 ± 30 BP (2021Ð1777 cal BC), and SUERC-38744, 3575 ± 30 BP (2041Ð1956 cal BC).

The burnt remains occupied the lower part of the vessels, but as the rims had crumbled some gravel had fallen in. All three urns were just below the surface, so that the rims had badly decayed whereas the bases were in much better condition.gg: This urn is 15 inches high and 13 inches in diameter at the top and is of hard, smoothed, dark-cored ware. It has a plain internally bevelled rim; a cavetto forms the upper storey of the pot. Thus there is a carination upon which two opposing solid near-cylindrical handles have been set. These trail slightly at their bases, their ends having been flattened by the potter's finger tips, the prints of which remain. The urn bears no decoration, although probablyafter drying an attempt had been made to bore a hole from each side at a point just below the rim. This is identified as an enlarged food vesselhr: cremated remains, no further info",Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown,Unknown
